Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially answers the question. The answer mentions the number of days (hai ngày) a football player is allowed to rest, but it does so in the context of a specific team (Hà Nội) and a specific event (V-League 2017). The answer does not provide a general regulation on the number of days for all teams, but rather a specific instance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions 'trận đấu cuối cùng' (final game) which aligns with the question's context. However, it does not directly answer the question about the number of days off for players before the final game of the AFC Cup. Instead, it talks about V-League 2017 and a specific team, Ha Noi, which is not related to AFC Cup or the question being asked."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by stating that there is no information available about the time off for football players after an international tournament, which is a relevant response to the question's inquiry about the time off."

RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer initially seems irrelevant, it actually provides a direct response to the question. The answer states that there is no information available in the provided document about the number of days the government allows for a soccer player to rest.

However, the specific measures mentioned in the answer (adding more sanctions) are not mentioned in the question. The answer is partially relevant because it is related to the topic of discussion, but it does not precisely answer the question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the Foreign Minister of UAE, Anwar Gargash, and his statement about countries in the Arab Gulf discussing additional measures to penalize Doha.

The generated answer provides some relevant context, but it does not fully answer the question."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer mentions Underwriters Laboratories, it only provides the name of a report (Báo cáo thông số an toàn) without specifying the ranking or the inclusion of Vietnam's economy as the 6th safest in Southeast Asia.
