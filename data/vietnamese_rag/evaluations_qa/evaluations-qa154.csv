PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question. The question asks about a specific UEFA Champions League (UCL) final match, and the generated answer talks about a match that took place at Vicente Calderon, which is correct. However, the answer incorrectly states that the match belongs to La Liga, which is not relevant or accurate. A more relevant answer would provide the correct information about the UCL final match that took place at Vicente Calderon."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer starts by repeating the question, which is not relevant. The main part of the answer discusses the technology and layout of American submarines, mentioning the placement of sonar systems and torpedo rooms. While this information is related to the question's topic (US vs Russian submarines), it does not directly answer the question about the superiority of American submarines in detecting targets. The answer suggests that American submarines might have an advantage, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the relevance is partly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by explaining how the structure of American submarines helps them detect targets better. However, the answer also compares explicitly with the structure of Russian submarines, which is not directly relevant to the question. The question is focused on American submarines, so the comparison to Russian submarines is not necessary and distracts from the main topic."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains the correct keywords and phrases from the question, such as 'Ngày tính tăng giá dịch vụ giữ xe' and 'sân bay Tân Sơn Nhất'. However, the answer contains irrelevant information, specifically the phrase '5 SÃO', which is likely a typo and not present in the original question.
