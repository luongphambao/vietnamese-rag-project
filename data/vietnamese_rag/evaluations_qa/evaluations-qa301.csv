PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses a part of the question, specifically mentioning the size of land for businesses (DN), which is in line with the question.

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it addresses the main point of exempting fees, as mentioned in the question.
