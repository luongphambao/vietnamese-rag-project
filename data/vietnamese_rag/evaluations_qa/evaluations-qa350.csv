Overall, the answer partially addresses the topic but lacks clear relevance to the specific question."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially answers the question by mentioning a location where a species of whale was first discovered. However, the location mentioned (Hoek van Holland) is not a region known for its whale population, and the question seems to be asking about a specific region in Vietnam. The answer lacks specificity and relevance to the expected geographic region, hence it is only partly relevant."

This makes the answer only partly relevant to the original question."
