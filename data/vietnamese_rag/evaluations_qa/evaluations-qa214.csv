RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly answers the question about Emmanuel Macron's age when he took office as the President of France, which is 39 years old. The answer is accurate and relevant to the question, providing the exact information sought."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the question as it provides a counterintuitive statement about Emmanuel Macron being the youngest leader of France since Napoleon, followed by a factual correction that Macron is actually the youngest leader in French history, not the leader after Napoleon."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer starts by repeating the question, which is NOT relevant. However, the subsequent sentence provides a partial answer to the question, describing a missed opportunity by Ronaldo. The relevance is PARTLY_RELEVANT because the answer attempts to provide relevant information, but the initial repetition of the question reduces its overall relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer shares some similarities with the question, as it discusses an opportunity lost by Ronaldo, which might be related to 'bỏ lỡ cơ hội' (missed opportunity). However, the context and focus of the answer are not directly addressing the question's request for a specific distance from the goal frame ('cách khung thành'). Instead, it provides an anecdote about an incident where Ronaldo missed a chance at a distance of 5 meters from the goal frame."

This relevance is demonstrated through the topic coverage and the relation to the question, making it 'RELEVANT'."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it provides some information related to the question, specifically about the topic of Donald Trump and the tension between the US and Russia.

The answer uses the question to introduce a statement about a phone call between Trump and Putin, and then goes on to discuss Ukraine, which is not directly related to the original question."
