Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the question, which asks about the reactions of Middle Eastern countries to a US decision. The answer does mention the reactions of some countries in the region, specifically Saudi Arabia, UAE, and others in the Persian Gulf, but it does not directly address the US decision. The topic of Qatar and its alleged support for extremist groups is also not directly related to the question. Therefore, while there is some overlap between the answer and the question, it is not a direct or complete answer."

RELEVANT,"Although the answer initially seems to be stating that there is no information available about the land area, it actually acknowledges the lack of related information and hints that the concept of 'land area' might be discussed in a different context. This shows relevance to the question's inquiry about the current land area allocated to the military, even if it's a negative answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it acknowledges the question and attempts to provide some context. However, it fails to directly answer the question about the exact area (in ha) that has been allocated to the military and instead discusses some general information about the Military Zone 4 and the results of the defensive battle during the resistance war. As a result, the answer is not fully relevant to the question but still provides some indirectly related information."
