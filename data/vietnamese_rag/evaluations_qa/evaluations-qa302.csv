Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a direct answer to the question, stating the exact number of fatalities in a plane crash in Russia, which matches the question's inquiry."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question, providing specific information on the number of people who were killed (4) and injured (11) in a Russian plane accident, which is exactly what the question is asking."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the specific timing of a plane crash in Russia, which directly answers the question 'Tai nạn máy bay ở Nga đã xảy ra vào thời gian nào?' (When did the plane crash in Russia happen?). The answer is relevant and accurate, providing the local time (10h30 sáng) and date (19/12) mentioned in the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by mentioning a specific type of aircraft (Antonov An-2) related to an accident in Russia, including details about the incident, which corresponds to the question asking for the type of aircraft related to an accident in Russia."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a specific location where a plane accident in Russia occurred, which is relevant to the question asking about the location of the accident."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question and provides specific details about Minh Tú's interaction with a Filipino contestant, Maureen, when waiting for a flight to Malaysia."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not contain any information related to the question. The answer is a response to a question that is not even present in the question itself, and the content is unrelated to the topic ('Minh Tú' and 'Philippines'). The correct answers are elsewhere in the options (A or E)."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer mentions Minh Tú and a Philippines' contestant, it only provides a tangential detail unrelated to the question about what they did while waiting. The answer is somewhat relevant, but only partially, as it does not directly answer the question and provides redundant information not requested in the question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a rephrased version of the question itself, and does not provide any relevant information or answer to the question. The answer does not mention any specific activities that the person being referred to has done with someone."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the question, as it correctly identifies that Maureen is a representative from a country. However, it does not specify the correct country mentioned in the question (Vietnam, not the Philippines)."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately provides the name of the goalkeeper of Tottenham in the mentionable match, matching the question's requirements and context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer initially seems irrelevant, as it's another question asking for the name of a central defender of MU who participated in a match. However, the following text provides an answer by mentioning Chris Smalling and describing his performance in a Champions League match between MU and Basel. Although the question and the text don't directly match, the text is still relevant to the question, as it provides information about a MU defender's participation in a match. The relevance is not perfect, but it can be considered partly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions two specific football players (Trippier and Eriksen) and their teams. However, the question does not ask about their teams in general, but rather asks about the team they played for. The answer could be improved by further specifying the context or providing more relevant information, such as 'Trippier và Eriksen thi đấu cho đội Tottenham Hotspur và Denmark respectively'."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer only partially answers the question by mentioning Harry Kane as a player with a similar name to a type of fruit, but it does not explicitly state the type of fruit or provide a clear answer to the question. The question asks for the name of a Tottenham player with a name similar to a type of fruit, whereas the generated answer only provides the name of the player without providing the necessary information about the fruit."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer, 'Marcos Rashford', is relevant to the question because it mentions a Manchester United (MU) player whose name starts with the letter 'M', as required by the question."
