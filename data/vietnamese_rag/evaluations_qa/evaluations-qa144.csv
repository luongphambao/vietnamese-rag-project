Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some information related to the question, as it mentions Darren Baird and the 'ở nguyên tại chỗ' policy. However, the context and scope of the answer are not fully aligned with the question, as it focuses on specific types of buildings (those that have undergone major renovations) and does not provide a general examination of the policy."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer explicitly states it could not find information about Ông Darren Baird, it still acknowledges that the question pertains to a person. This makes the answer partly relevant to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides information about Darren Baird's role in the field of fire safety, which is directly related to the question. The answer not only mentions his role but also provides specific details about his work and a related event, making it relevant to the question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the question because it mentions the situation where a person or object is being approached by the police, which is related to the question's context. However, the generated answer focuses more on the specific actions taken by the perpetrators (using pump pipes and wooden clubs) and the police's response (firing their guns in the air), which is not directly relevant to what the person/object has done when being approached by the police. The answer misses the core aspect of the question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a scenario about someone jumping into a river to escape from the police, whereas the question is asking about what someone did when they realized the police were checking a boat. The two scenarios are entirely different, making the generated answer non-relevant to the question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is completely unrelated to the question. The question asks about the actions of a person when approached by the police, but the answer provides a scenario involving a male being stabbed and hospitalized, with no mention of police. The context and content of the answer are irrelevant to the question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is in Vietnamese, uses different contexts such as 'mạn sà lan' (which is not a common concept in Greece where the question is likely to be asked) and 'tổ tuần tra' (which is a traffic police team in Vietnam, unrelated to the Greek police), and describes a boat being attacked by a pipe and a club. The answer does not provide any relevant information to the question and seems to be generated based on a completely different scenario."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question of why Chinese journalists criticized US President Donald Trump, specifically citing disagreements over North Korea and China's role in resolving the nuclear crisis. The answer provides detailed explanations and quotes related to the issue, making it highly relevant to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a specific stance of the US on the role of Beijing in resolving the Korean crisis, which matches the question's inquiry about 'quan điểm của Mỹ về vai trò của Bắc Kinh' (the view of the US on the role of Beijing). The answer showcases the US's expectations on China's involvement in the crisis, which is relevant to the question's context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a hypothetical scenario of China's possible stance on the issue of North Korea, which is directly related to the question asking about China's role in the North Korea issue."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses the US's accusation towards China in the context of the Korean Crisis. The answer mentions specific scenarios and potential actions, including a nuclear attack by North Korea, an attack by the US and South Korea to change North Korea's government, and China's hypothetical responses. While the answer does not directly quote the exact accusation, it provides context and potential implications related to the question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by mentioning that there is no answer provided regarding the requirements implemented by China according to the UN. However, it does not directly answer the question about what specific requirements have been implemented, and instead presents a lack of information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the question because it provides specific examples of how the regulations related to hospital transfer and health insurance in Vietnam affect patients and their families. The answer highlights the difficulties patients face when trying to transfer to a different hospital in a different province, which is in line with the question's inquiry about what regulations cause inconvenience to patients."
