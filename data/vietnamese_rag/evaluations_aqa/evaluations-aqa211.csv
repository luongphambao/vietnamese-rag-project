RELEVANT,"The generated answer captures the main reason for the delay in publishing the conclusion of the inspection, which is the severe impact of the flood on the district.

NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer. The original answer talks about a specific incident of flooding in Yên Bái Province, which led to a delay in the publication of a report by the Inspectorate.
