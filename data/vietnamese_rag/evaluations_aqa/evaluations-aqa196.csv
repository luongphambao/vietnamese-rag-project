Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not provide any information about the company's action to correct the system error, which is what the generated question is asking for. Instead, it describes a different incident at a different transformer station and provides a detailed account of its resolution."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question about the behavior of the mother who saw the 1-year-old child being abused. However, it deviates from the context of the original answer, which revolves around a specific incident on a flight where the family was asked to leave the plane and banned from future flights. The generated answer provides general information about signs of mothers who see their children being abused, which is not directly related to the original answer. The answer lacks the specificity and relevance required to match the context of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely mirrors the original answer in terms of content and context. Both answers discuss the same incident, the child kicking the seat in front, and the subsequent reaction from the passenger and the airline's actions. The generated answer even includes the same specific details, such as the age of the child, the location of the kicking, and the consequences for the family. The only slight difference is the minor change in wording and sentence structure, but overall, the generated answer accurately conveys the same information as the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed explanation for the family being banned from future flights, including the reason for the ban (violation of safety rules and disturbance to other passengers) and the sequence of events leading up to the incident.

RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, covering the same list of song titles ('Vâng! Chính em, Cổ tích anh và em, Là anh đó…') and maintaining the same structure and format. The only minor difference is a typo in the generated answer ('Vằng!' instead of 'Vâng!'), which does not affect the overall relevance and accuracy of the answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it does mention that a song by H.A.T is a story-like theme, which is indeed mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer lacks the specific song titles and album details mentioned in the original answer. It provides a general statement without providing any concrete examples or details, making it only partially relevant."
