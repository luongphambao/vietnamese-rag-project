Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately provides the maximum number of months of unemployment benefits that can be received, which is 12 months. However, it also provides additional information about the calculation of the number of months of unemployment benefits based on the number of months of insurance premiums paid, which is not present in the original answer. While the generated answer is generally relevant to the original question, the additional information makes it not entirely identical to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the information in the original answer. It mentions the basis for calculating the unemployment benefits, which is the number of months of unemployment insurance contributions. However, the generated answer is incomplete and contains some inaccuracies. For example, it states that each 12 months of contributions entitles the employee to 3 months of unemployment benefits, which is not supported by the original text. Additionally, the generated answer does not mention the maximum 12-month limit for receiving unemployment benefits, as stated in the original text."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer. It correctly answers the question 'Sau bao lâu đóng bảo hiểm thất nghiệp thì người lao động được hưởng thêm 1 tháng trợ cấp?' with the correct timeframe of 36 tháng. However, the original answer provides a more detailed explanation of how the 12-month mark leads to an additional month of support, which is not fully captured in the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a verbatim copy of the original answer, including the same sentence structure and wording. The content is identical, conveying the same information and idea. Hence, it is deemed RELEVANT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, with the same text and structure. The only difference is the format, which is a question-answer pair rather than a standalone statement. The content and context of the generated answer are identical to the original answer, which indicates high relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant as it acknowledges the specific scenario (using tài sản công khác to thanh toán Dự án BT) mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer lacks the detail and condition mentioned in the original answer (following approval by Thủ tướng Chính phủ's văn bản chấp thuận). The generated answer's content is more of a paraphrase of the original question rather than an answer, which makes it not fully relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed description of the regulations and procedures for using public assets to pay for BT projects, which is directly related to the original answer. While not identical, the generated answer accurately summarizes the key points from the original answer, including the need for approval by the Prime Minister and the relevant laws and regulations."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is about Nghị định 126 năm 2020 regulating Kiểm lâm viên, but the original answer is about Kiểm lâm viên being a type of government official. The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer, as it is about a specific regulation rather than the definition of Kiểm lâm viên."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer mentions 'ngạch' which is similar to the 'ngạch kiểm lâm' in the original answer, the context and wording are not exactly the same. The original answer mentions 'ngạch kiểm lâm' and 'chức' which is not present in the generated answer. Therefore, while the generated answer partially addresses the question, it is not entirely relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original question, but in a different aspect. While the original answer defines what Kiểm lâm viên is, the generated question asks for an organization that has Kiểm lâm viên. The generated answer somehow related to the question by stating that '_Check organization'_ does not have a regulation mentioned in the document. However, it does not directly answer the question nor provide any information about an organization that has Kiểm lâm viên."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the expected relevance as both answers refer to 'Kiểm lâm viên'. However, the generated answer is specific to a function ('Kiểm soát viên') whereas the original answer provides a more general description of a Kiểm lâm viên's role. The generated answer lacks the context about the organization ('cơ quan kiểm lâm') and the specific description ('nh thuộc các ngạch kiểm lâm, biên chế trong'), making it less relevant overall."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it also describes the role and responsibilities of a Kiểm lâm viên, including their duties in conservation, environmental protection, and forest management. The generated answer provides more detailed information about the specific tasks and responsibilities of a Kiểm lâm viên, which is in line with the original answer. However, the generated answer does not exactly replicate the original answer, which is brief and to the point, whereas the generated answer is longer and provides more context and examples."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is a different piece of text from the original answer, it is still relevant because it provides a specific regulation related to the topic of service provision for dance and entertainment activities, which is in line with the original answer. The generated answer is also accurate in providing the specific regulation and date, which matches the description in the original answer. Overall, the generated answer is relevant to the original answer but provides more detailed and accurate information."
