PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant to the original answer because it acknowledges Messi's high probability of scoring in the El Clásico match between Real Madrid and Barcelona. However, the generated answer also introduces new information about Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, which is not present in the original answer. This introduction of new information reduces the relevance of the generated answer to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer touches upon the same topic as the original answer, which is Ronaldo's participation in a specific match. However, the original answer specifically mentions Ronaldo's injury and its impact on his performance, whereas the generated answer does not mention the injury. The generated answer also strays from the original answer's main point by discussing Ronaldo's potential departure from Real Madrid due to tax allegations. While the generated answer is partially relevant to the topic, it lacks the specific details and context provided in the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original question or context. The original question was not about Ronaldo's physical state, but rather about his chances of scoring against Real Madrid given his physical condition. The generated answer provides an anecdote about Ronaldo's physical state in a different match, which is not related to the original context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer in terms of content and context.
