NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a statement saying 'Câu trả lời của bạn là một câu hỏi.', which is unrelated to the original answer about De Bruyne's dissatisfaction with the referee in a match between Man City and Napoli. The generated answer appears to be a response to a different question and does not provide any relevant information to the original answer."
