RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct copy of the relevant part from the original answer, which correctly identifies the two types of individuals that must have a paper certification about food safety (ATTP) when participating in food production and business activities. The only difference is that the original answer is part of a larger text that lists the objects that have been certified, while the generated answer is a standalone response. However, the content and context of the generated answer are very similar to the original answer, making it highly relevant."

RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, containing the same relevant information about the fine range for driving on the highway. The generated question is slightly redundant, but it does not affect the relevance of the answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer. While it does mention specific fines for transportation-related offenses, the scope and context of the fines mentioned are different from the original answer. The original answer mentions a specific fine range (6,000,000 - 8,000,000 VND) for unknown offense(s), whereas the generated answer provides a range of fines for specific traffic violations on highways. The generated answer also includes unrelated information about the requirements for safe driving on highways, which makes it less relevant to the original answer."

The relevance is very high, and the generated answer accurately conveys the same information as the original answer."

While it correctly states that the National Assembly Committee needs to be consulted when the National Assembly is not in session, it does not explicitly mention the National Assembly's approval in such cases, unlike the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question but includes irrelevant information. The original answer specifically mentions 'bắt giam đại biểu quốc hội' (arresting a national assembly representative) but the generated answer broadens the scope to 'không được bắt, giam, giữ, khởi tố đại biểu Quốc hội' (not arresting, detaining, or prosecuting a national assembly representative) and adds unrelated details.

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"While the generated answer discusses the temporary detention of a National Assembly deputy and the requirements for reporting to the National Assembly or the Permanent Committee, it does not explicitly discuss the revocation of immunity. The generated answer provides more context on the procedures for reporting and temporary detention, whereas the original answer focuses on the requirements for detention and revocation of immunity. As a result, the generated answer is partly relevant to the original answer."

The generated answer also provides an example of a specific regulation (the approval of the National Assembly or the Standing Committee of the National Assembly in the absence of the National Assembly) which is also present in the original answer. The content and context of the generated answer match the original answer, but some additional information is added."
