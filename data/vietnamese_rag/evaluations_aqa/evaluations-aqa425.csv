Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer. The original answer is about the conditions for receiving recognition or commendation from the department head for exceptional achievements, while the generated answer discusses receiving a prize or award, mentioning a specific procedure for claiming the prize (reporting to the relevant department and providing evidence). The answer is completely off-topic and does not address the original question about the conditions for receiving an award."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by mentioning that apart from Dân quân tự vệ, the people who can be awarded a certificate of merit are the leaders of units from the Battalion Command Unit or equivalent and above. However, the original answer provides more detailed information on the conditions and criteria for awarding such certificates, including exceptional achievements in various competitions and campaigns. The generated answer does not cover this added context and focuses only on the hierarchy of leaders responsible for awarding the certificates."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, including the exact same figure range (100.000 đồng to 200.000 đồng). The generated answer is a direct response to the generated question, which asks about the fine for changing a motorcycle's exhaust. The close match in content and context indicates a high level of relevance and accuracy."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer conveys the same range of penalties (100,000-200,000 VND) as the original answer, but the context and purpose are different. The original answer is a general statement about a specific penalty range, while the generated answer is a response to a more specific question about modifying a motorcycle's exhaust system. While the answer is partially relevant, it is not directly related to the context and purpose of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is almost identical to the original answer, and it provides the exact same information about the fine range for modifying a motorcycle's exhaust pipe."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer refers to a different range of fines (6.000.000 - 8.000.000 VND) compared to the original answer (100.000 - 200.000 VND), and is unrelated to the concept of installing a speedometer on a motorbike (pố độ) as mentioned in the generated question. The content and context of the generated answer are not similar to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is related to the topic of bomb survey, it only provides a specific timing ('sau khi điều tra' or 'after investigation') without providing the complete information about the bombing survey activity (as mentioned in the original answer). The original answer describes the survey as being conducted with specific equipment to assess the contamination status, whereas the generated answer does not provide that level of detail."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, suggesting that the RAG system has successfully retained the same information and context as the original answer."

The language and structure of the generated answer are very similar to the original answer, indicating a high degree of similarity and relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially answers the question 'Diện tích nào được khảo sát bom mìn?' by providing a description of the area being surveyed after the war. However, it does not directly answer the question about the area being surveyed, which is the scope of the original answer. The generated answer is missing the specific context provided in the original answer, such as the purpose of the survey and the possible presence of contaminated areas."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partly relevant because it is related to the original answer, as both deal with the consequences of misbehaving passengers on a bus. However, the specific fine ranges mentioned in the answers differ, with the original answer ranging from 2-3 million VND and the generated answer ranging from 1-2 million VND. Additionally, the generated answer uses the phrase 'thủ phạt' which is not present in the original answer, which further reduces its relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it provides the same information and range of fine amounts mentioned. The only difference is that the original answer is phrased as a statement, while the generated answer is phrased as a paraphrased response to the question."
