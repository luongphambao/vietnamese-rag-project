Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a specific location information, which is a crucial part of the original answer. It correctly identified the district (phường Linh Trung) and the city (quận Thủ Đức, TPHCM) where the accident occurred. Although the generated answer does not cover all the details mentioned in the original answer (e.g., the exact time), it accurately focuses on the geographical location, making it a relevant answer."
NONE_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides incorrect information regarding the date, time, and location of the accident. The original answer mentions 22/9, 0h30, and Linh Trung, while the generated answer mentions 1/7, 1h, and Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh. The answers are not related in terms of the accident's circumstances."
NON_RELEVANT,The generated answer 'Ngày xảy ra tai nạn là ngày 23/9' does not match the original answer 'Vụ tai nạn xảy ra vào rạng sáng 22/9...' which explicitly states the accident occurred on 22/9. The generated answer is incorrect and unrelated to the original answer.
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is completely unrelated to the original answer. The original answer describes a traffic accident, while the generated answer talks about Xa lộ Hà Nội being an airport route. The context and content are vastly different, making the generated answer non-relevant to the original answer."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the main reason for the decrease in pepper price in Vietnam, which is due to the abundant supply. However, it fails to mention the additional factors mentioned in the original answer, such as the peeling season, the increase in pepper planting area, and the businesses' effort to reduce purchase prices to make a profit. Furthermore, the generated answer is missing some key context and tries to summarize the main point in a simplistic way, which reduces its relevance compared to the original answer."
