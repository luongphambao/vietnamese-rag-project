Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer only focuses on the processing time of the Ministry of Transport, it is directly related to the original text, which discusses the procedures and timelines for the Ministry of Transport to respond to a port's request to stop receiving foreign vessels. The generated answer accurately extracts the specific information mentioned in the original text (05 days) and provides a concise answer to the question. The relevance is considered high due to the direct connection between the question and the original text."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because they both discuss the same topic, which is the responsibles in the case of a port no longer receiving foreign vessels. Although the generated answer is concise and only provides a brief summary, it accurately recovers the main points from the original answer. The specific agency (Bộ Giao thông vận tải) responsible is also correctly identified in both the generated and original answers, which further supports the relevance of the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately mirrors the content of the original answer, providing the same list of units that are required to report to the Ministry of Finance. The phrase 'thống kê ngành tài chính' (statistical reporting in the finance sector) is added to the end of the list, which is a minor modification that does not affect the relevance of the answer to the original context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, both providing the same information about the location of the unit receiving statistical reports in the financial industry on a reporting form. The only minor difference is the addition of 'Nam' which is not present in the original answer. Overall, the generated answer accurately conveys the relevant information and is very similar to the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a rephrased question, whereas the original answer provides a specific penalty amount. The generated answer does not provide any new information or relevance to the original answer, making it non-relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not directly match the original answer, which specifies a fine range of 400,000 - 600,000 VND. However, the generated answer provides some related information on fined regulations, albeit indirectly. The explanation about a different regulatory context and the specific fine range mentioned do show some relevance to the original answer. Still, the connection is not exact, making it PARTLY_RELEVANT."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions a different fine range for racing (5.000.000 - 7.000.000 VND) compared to the original answer (400.000 - 600.000 VND), indicating a lack of relevance."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not address the original answer's content and context. The original answer provides a specific range of fines (400.000-600.000 đồng), whereas the generated answer is unrelated to the topic, discussing a hypothetical scenario and ultimately stating there is no information about the fine for speed limit violation."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is about the length of the line of vehicles waiting to pay tolls before a toll station, whereas the original answer is about the fine amount. The topic and context are completely different, indicating that the generated answer is not relevant to the original question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a range of fine levels, similar to the original answer. However, the specific values are different, with the original answer ranging from 8,000,000 to 10,000,000 and the generated answer ranging from 10,000,000 to 20,000,000. The relevance is partly relevant as it addresses the same topic of fine levels, but the values are not identical."
