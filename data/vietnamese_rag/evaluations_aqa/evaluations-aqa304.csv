RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'IS đã di chuyển sang bờ phía tây của sông Euphrates' is relevant to the original answer 'Các binh sĩ IS đã băng qua sông Euphrates và cố gắng thâm nhập vùng Palmyra ở hướng Nam Syria' as it correctly identifies the direction of IS forces movement across the Euphrates River, which is consistent with the context from the original answer. The generated answer is a specific and accurate detail that supports the original answer, indicating relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially supports the original answer by mentioning that IS was trying to expand its influence and control the region. However, the original answer does not mention the specifics of the Kalibr missiles and targets mentioned in the generated answer, which makes the relevance partial."
