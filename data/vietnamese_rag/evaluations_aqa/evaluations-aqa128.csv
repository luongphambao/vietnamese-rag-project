NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is about cutting off nearly 90% of crude oil exports to North Korea, which is not mentioned in the original answer. The original answer mentions specific items like coal, iron, copper, seafood, and labor export restrictions, but not oil exports. Even though both answers mention restrictions, they are unrelated to each other."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, covering the same information and exact same points ('than, sắt, quặng sắt, chì, quặng chì và hải sản'). The language and structure of the answers are also identical, demonstrating a high degree of relevance and similarity between the generated and original answers."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately extracts a specific point from the original answer, which is about the prohibition on increasing the number of North Korean workers abroad. Although the question asks about the impact, the answer correctly focuses on the related provision in the drafted resolution."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, rephrasing the same information. The only difference is the reordering of some sentences, but the core content remains the same.

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions La Liga 2017/18, which is partially relevant to the original answer.
