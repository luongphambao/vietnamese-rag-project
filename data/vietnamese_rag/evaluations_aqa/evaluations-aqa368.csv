Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides relevant information related to the original answer. Although it is not identical, it discusses the same topic (lập thành văn bản có công chứng) and provides specific scenarios or parties involved (bên nhờ mang thai hộ & bên mang thai hộ) that require the document to be notarized. The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides context and examples illustrating the need for the notarized document."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides relevant information related to the original answer, which is the requirement to formulate a document with a notary's certification. The generated answer describes the contents that must be included in the document authorizing surrogacy, specifically referring to the provisions of the Law and the rights and obligations of the parties involved. While the generated answer does not directly match the original answer, it is related to the same topic and provides additional context, making it relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer because it discusses the legal regulations regarding surrogacy and mentions the importance of a written agreement with a certified public official, which is also mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer provides more detailed information and examples from the Law on Marriage and Family 2014, whereas the original answer is a more general statement. Despite the differences, the generated answer still addresses the same topic and concept, making it relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is related to the original answer in that it discusses a penalty for a specific behavior, but it is not entirely relevant. The original answer provides a range of fines for an unspecified offense, whereas the generated answer provides a specific range of fines for a specific behavior (lấn chiếm rừng phòng hộ) with a certain condition (diện tích dưới 2.000 m2). Although the two answers share some commonalities, they are distinct and cover different scenarios, hence the PARTLY_RELEVANT evaluation."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a range of fines, albeit for a different scenario than the original answer. While the original answer provides a fine range for lấn chiếm (occupying) forests with a specific area, the generated answer provides a fine range for lấn chiếm (occupying) protected forest areas with a specific size. Although the concepts are related, they are not identical, making the generated answer partially relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer provides a range of fines, it's not entirely relevant to the original answer. The original answer specifies a range of fines from 32,000,000 to 40,000,000 VND, whereas the generated answer gives a range of fines from 7,000,000 to 15,000,000 VND. The two ranges do intersect, but the context of the original and generated answers is not exactly the same. The generated question asks about the fine for a specific area (12,000-15,000 m2), whereas the original answer doesn't provide such a specific context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the context of the original answer, which is related to the fine amount. However, it fails to accurately reflect the specific range of fine amounts mentioned in the original answer, replacing the exact values (32.000.000 dong to 40.000.000 dong) with a more general range (2.000 to under 4.000 m2). Additionally, the unit of measurement was changed from dong to m2, which further reduces the relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, it accurately provides the fine range for violating forest protection regulations, including the exact numbers. The context and content of the generated answer are identical to the original, making it highly relevant and accurate."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of mentioning the size of the Badge, specifically the diameter (36 mm) and the height (54 mm). However, it also provides an incorrect dimension, the width (64 mm), which is not present in the original answer. Additionally, it does not accurately describe the shape of the Badge, which is a circle, nor does it mention the other details present in the original answer, such as the star, the wheel, and the character 'CA'."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer only responds to a small part of the original answer, which is the color of the star on the Công an hiệu badge. However, it does not account for the rest of the badge's design, description, and additional details mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by mentioning the correct information about the star being surrounded by two golden ears of rice. However, it does not provide a comprehensive answer, as it only focuses on one aspect of the image. The original answer describes the entire design of the badge, including the star, ears of rice, and half-wheel, whereas the generated answer only mentions the star and its surrounding elements."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately answers the question about the content of the gold star on the Communist Public Security Forces' badge. The original description mentions that the half-bike shape on the badge has 'CA' characters in the center, which matches the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it confirms the same principle: a person or legal entity cannot be a representative for both parties in a transfer of shares contract. The generated answer provides more specific information about the contract, but it is still about the same concept, namely, the prohibition of self-representation in a transaction."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is almost identical to the original answer, only with a slight rephrasing of the sentence structure. It accurately conveys the same information and concept as the original answer, which is that a person cannot represent themselves in a civil transaction and instead must appoint a representative. The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer and provides the same level of accuracy and relevance."
