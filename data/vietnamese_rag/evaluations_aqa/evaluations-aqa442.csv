Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is concise and focuses on the confirmation process of the supplemental inland waterway notification, it is mostly extracted from the original answer and provides similar information. The only minor difference is the rewording of the same sentences and phrases, which does not significantly alter the relevance of the answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately responds to the generated question, which is related to the original answer. The generated answer specifically highlights that the procedure for confirming the supplementary inland waterway announcement is similar to the procedure for confirming the inland waterway announcement, which is a key detail mentioned in the original answer. The relevance is high because the generated answer is a direct answer to the question and provides a specific example from the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question of the difference between báo đường thủy nội địa and đường thủy nội địa bổ sung. It correctly mentions the need for report approval and similarities in procedures between both. However, the answer also drifts into discussing the report's purpose and legal aspects, which are not entirely relevant to the question. The relevance is not exact, but the answer does provide some useful information, hence PARTLY_RELEVANT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, both in terms of content and structure. The generated answer reproduces the same information and phrases as the original answer, with only minor differences in wording.

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially recalls the original text, but the relevance is not exact. The generated answer does mention the purpose of the program, which is to manage pest organisms, but it lacks the specific details and sentence structure from the original answer. The generated answer also contains extra information that is not present in the original answer, which reduces its relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the content of the original answer. While it correctly references the need to apply measures to prevent harm, the specific regulation and standards mentioned in the original answer (Chi cục kiểm dịch thực vật vùng) are not mentioned in the generated answer. Furthermore, the generated answer specifically focuses on the livestock and fisheries safety act, which is not directly related to the original answer's context. The relevance is not high due to the lack of precision and scope matching."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information, such as the requirement for a vocational degree and real-world training, but it deviates from the original answer's relevant information, which refers to the submission procedures for obtaining a nursing practice certificate. The generated answer also introduces new requirements that are not mentioned in the original answer, which affects its overall relevance."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer does not provide a direct answer to the question, it is relevant because it refers to the same topic and mentions the same context as the original answer.

The focus and context of the two answers are completely different, making the relevance of the generated answer non-relevant to the original answer."
