The generated answer also mentions the application of other relevant laws if there are specific details about payment not specified in the contract. The only slight deviation is the addition of 'nhà đầu tư' (investor) in the generated answer, which was not present in the original answer. However, this does not significantly affect the relevance of the generated answer."
