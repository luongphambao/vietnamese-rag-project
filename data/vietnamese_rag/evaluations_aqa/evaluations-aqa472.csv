Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides the specific requirements for the family of the student to make a request for the student to return home to attend the funeral, which is mentioned in the original answer. The content is similar, with minor variations in wording, but the essential information is preserved."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially refers to the original information. While it accurately mentions that the family is responsible for the transportation costs, it only focuses on this specific point and misses other crucial details about the circumstances and requirements for the student's return to their family for bereavement purposes. The generated answer lacks context and is less comprehensive than the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately clarifies the threshold for compensation for occupational disease as 'suy giảm khả năng lao động phải từ 5% trở lên' (ability reduction must be 5% or more), which is present in the original answer. The generated answer is relevant and directly answers the generated question, while also providing more specific information than the original answer."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated question is slightly different from the original context, the generated answer accurately explains the requirement for a 5% or higher reduction in work ability to qualify for compensation, which is in line with the content of the original answer. The generated answer effectively provides a clarification and justification for the condition, making it relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not provide a direct answer to the question, but it partially relates to the topic. The provided text mentions the cases where workers are entitled to benefits, including those with a work-related illness and a decline in working capacity from 5% or more, which is similar to the original answer. However, the generated answer lacks specific details and relevant information mentioned in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides the necessary condition for being compensated when suffering from an occupational disease, which is the same topic as the original answer. The answer mentions the requirement of a medical expert committee's conclusion and a percentage of work ability reduction, which is also mentioned in the original answer. The only difference is the wording and phrasing, but the core information is consistent."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions 'suy giảm khả năng lao động từ 5% trở lên', which is a key element in the original answer. However, the generated answer is not a direct quote of the original answer, and the context is slightly different (it's an answer to a different question). The similarity is partial, but the content is not identical, hence the classification as PARTLY_RELEVANT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is directly related to the original answer, as it provides the same explanation for why the name of the business location must include the phrase 'Địa điểm kinh doanh'. The similarity is high, and the generated answer accurately conveys the same information as the original answer, thereby showing a high level of relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant as it mentions the requirement for 'Địa điểm kinh doanh' which is present in the original answer. However, it does not respond to the question 'Điều lệ cho phép thêm thông tin gì trong tên địa điểm kinh doanh?' as it does not provide any information about what can be added to the name of the business location, instead it repeats the same information. It lacks the clarity and specificity required to fully address the question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially discusses the relevance of the name of a business location, but in a different context. It mentions exceptions like branches and representative offices, which is related to the original answer's mention of the required phrase 'Địa điểm kinh doanh'. However, the generated answer does not directly address the coherence of the phrase in the name of a business location, which is the main point of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it addresses the same topic as the original answer, which is the penalty for incorrect accounting content. However, the specific figure range provided in the generated answer (1.000.000 - 3.000.000) is different from the original answer (5.000.000 - 10.000.000). The generated answer provides a narrower range for the penalty, which is still related to the topic but not entirely matching the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions a specific range of fines ('khoảng phạt tiền...'), which is similar to the original answer. However, the range provided in the generated answer (60.000 đồng to 100.000 đồng) does not match the range in the original answer (5.000.000 đồng to 10.000.000 đồng). The context of the generated question also seems to be related to book-keeping errors ('sai sót trong hạch toán'), but the original answer does not provide a specific context. Despite these differences, the generated answer still conveys a concept of fines being levied, which is what the original answer is trying to convey."
