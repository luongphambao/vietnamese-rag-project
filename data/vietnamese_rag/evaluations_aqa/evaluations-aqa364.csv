The generated answer shows a good understanding of the context and content of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it mentions the organization (Cục Đường thủy nội địa Việt Nam) and the type of infrastructure (kết cấu hạ tầng đường thủy nội địa) being managed. The generated answer also provides a more detailed list of specific types of infrastructure, which is consistent with the original answer's description of the organization's responsibilities. However, the generated answer is not entirely identical to the original answer, as it provides additional details not mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer, accurately mentioning the responsibility of Ủy ban nhân dân cấp tỉnh in managing and maintaining the inland waterway infrastructure at the provincial level. However, it also includes additional information about the management roles of other entities, such as Cục Đường thủy nội địa Việt Nam and Sở Giao thông vận tải, which is not present in the original answer. This additional information is not crucial to understanding the original answer, but it does alter the focus and structure of the generated answer, making it PARTLY_RELEVANT rather than fully RELEVANT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a paraphrased version of the original answer, maintaining the same information structure and content. Although the wording is slightly different, the generated answer accurately summarizes the points mentioned in the original answer, including the roles of Cục Đường thủy nội địa Việt Nam, Ủy ban nhân dân cấp tỉnh, and các nhân đầu tư xây dựng in managing and maintaining Đường thủy nội địa. The answer effectively conveys the same message as the original answer, making it relevant and accurate."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the main point that a private investor has the right to decide on the infrastructure they invest in, but then it goes on to mention specific regulations and requirements for changes to be made to the approved plan. This additional information is not directly related to the original answer's point about the organization responsible for managing and maintaining the infrastructure, but it is related to the topic of private investors' decisions regarding infrastructure. Overall, the generated answer captures some relevant information, but it also includes additional details that are not directly relevant to the original answer's main point."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it accurately extracts a specific point from the original text about the organization responsible for managing the inland waterway infrastructure within the management scope of the Ministry of Transport. However, it only focuses on a single point (Cục Đường thủy nội địa Việt Nam) and does not accurately capture the entire content and scope of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely matches the original answer in terms of the specific information and fines mentioned. Although the wording is slightly different, the content is equivalent and conveys the same information about the fine for individuals who use someone under 18 to sell tobacco."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the correct regulation (Nghị định 185/2013/NĐ-CP) and the corresponding fine ranges for individuals and organizations, which is identical to the original answer. The answer is accurate and provides the same information as the original answer, indicating high relevance."

RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it directly provides the information about the maximum fine that an organization can be imposed for using a minor to sell tobacco, which is up to 40,000,000 dong. The answer is a verbatim copy of the relevant information from the original answer, demonstrating a strong alignment between the generated and original answers."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the main idea of the original answer, which is that there will be a fine for using someone under 18 to sell tobacco products. However, the generated answer lacks specific details such as the fine amount ranges mentioned in the original answer (10,000,000 - 20,000,000 VND for individuals and 20,000,000 - 40,000,000 VND for organizations). This lack of specificity makes the generated answer less relevant compared to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, with almost identical language and structure. The content is identical, and the context is also relevant, as both answers discuss the possibility of seeking government intervention in a situation where construction causes unsanitary conditions."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer touches on relevant topics such as the legal framework for construction and property rights, but it provides more detailed information than the original answer. While it mentions that the person having the right to request the neighboring restaurant to be handled is protected by law, it goes beyond the original answer by providing specific details about the limits and conditions for construction according to the law. Consequently, the relevance to the original answer is partly relevant, but the generated answer provides additional information, differing from the original answer in scope and depth."
