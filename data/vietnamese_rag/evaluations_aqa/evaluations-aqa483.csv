Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is completely unrelated to the original answer and the question, as it provides a vague and unspecific response that is unrelated to the topic of criminal procedure in Vietnam. The answer seems to be a generic message related to legal affairs, but it does not address the question or provide relevant information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions 'Cơ quan điều tra hoặc của Tòa án' which is related to the original answer mentioning 'Viện kiểm sát cùng cấp'. However, it does not directly answer the original sentence, which specifically mentions 'lệnh bắt tạm giam' and 'phê chuẩn' in a specific context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides relevant information related to the circumstances under which a temporary detention order can be issued without approval, but it is not directly addressing the original question of when a command to arrest and temporarily detain a suspect does not need approval. The generated answer is informative but not directly addressing the issue, which is why it is considered partly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches with the original answer in terms of describing conditions for considering a stock as being issued. However, it goes beyond the original answer by providing additional details, such as the need for registration and a certificate of registration, which are not mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer also uses more formal language, indicating a different tone and level of formality from the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the target of the registration book (sổ đăng ký cổ đông) and provides a list of information that is typically recorded, including the number of shares and current share value. However, it lacks the crucial context of 'cổ phiếu đã phát hành' (issued shares) mentioned in the original answer, which is the key concept related to the registration book."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer provides some relevant information, it lacks specificity and detail compared to the original answer. The original answer specifically mentions the need to 'phân công nhiệm vụ cụ thể đối với từng thành viên trong đoàn' and 'báo cáo tổ chức kiểm định về kế hoạch làm việc của đoàn đánh giá ngoài trước ngày khảo sát sơ bộ ít nhất 05 ngày làm việc'. The generated answer does not include these specific details and instead provides a more general outline of the plan. Additionally, the generated answer focuses on the 'chất lượng giáo dục nghề nghiệp' aspect which is not explicitly stated in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the context of the original answer. While it mentions the timeframe for the evaluation, it is not a direct replication of the original content. The original answer emphasizes the importance of providing a detailed plan to the organization being evaluated, while the generated answer provides a specific timeline for the evaluation process. The relevance is limited to the mention of timeframe, but it does not capture the entire context of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially corresponds to the original answer. The generated answer mentions the assignment of specific tasks to members of the evaluation team, which is consistent with the original answer. However, the generated answer does not explicitly mention the requirement for uniformity among team members, which is an important aspect of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the relevant information from the original answer. It mentions that the plan should be reported to 'các cơ quan, tổ chức, cá nhân có liên quan đến đoàn đánh giá ngoài và ban quản lý dự án' before the preliminary survey, which is related to the requirement in the original answer that the plan should be reported to 'cơ sở được đánh giá ngoài' before the preliminary survey. However, the generated answer does not fully capture the original answer's emphasis on the importance of sharing the plan with the evaluated organization and reporting it to the organization that conducts the evaluation."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer. The original answer specifies the fine amounts for individual and organizations when building illegal structures in urban areas, while the generated answer mentions a different figure (50 million VND) and a separate consequence (criminal punishment), which is unrelated to the original context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a specific penalty range for individuals who illegally construct a project at a highway tunnel, which is closely related to the original answer's penalty range for individuals who construct projects illegally. Although the penalty range is different (10,000,000 - 50,000,000 vs 6,000,000 - 8,000,000), the context and topic are the same, making it a relevant answer."
