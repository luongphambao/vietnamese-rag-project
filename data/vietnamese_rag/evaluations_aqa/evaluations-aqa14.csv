Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer and the provided question. It seems to be a statement about the context being unable to provide information on Italy's World Cup qualification in 2018, which does not address the original answer or the question 'How did Italy's World Cup 2018 qualifying round occur?'"
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately mentions the main reason for HLV Giampiero Ventura's potential termination, which is Italy's failure to qualify for the World Cup 2018.

The tone and language used in the generated answer are also slightly different from the original answer, which makes it less similar and less relevant."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not provide any information about why FIGC will hold a meeting, which is the purpose of the generated question.
