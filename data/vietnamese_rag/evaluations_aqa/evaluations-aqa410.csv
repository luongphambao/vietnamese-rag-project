NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not accurately reflect the information provided in the original answer. The original answer specifically mentions that students must meet certain conditions, including having graduated from high school with good grades and study results, while the generated answer mentions being over 18 years old, which is not mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer also adds an unrelated condition, which is not present in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it accurately describes the scope of the customs deposit, which includes the time period from temporary import to re-export, including any extensions. The answer is similar to the original answer in terms of its content, providing a concise and specific explanation of the deposit period, whereas the original answer gives a broader explanation of the deposit procedure. The generated answer is more focused on the specific question, but still conveys the essential information, making it a relevant answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a specific numerical value (3000 USD) as the equivalent amount, whereas the original answer does not mention a specific value. The original answer only mentions that the amount is 'số tiền thuế nhập khẩu của hàng hóa tạm nhập' (the import tax of the temporarily imported goods), which implies it's a variable amount.
