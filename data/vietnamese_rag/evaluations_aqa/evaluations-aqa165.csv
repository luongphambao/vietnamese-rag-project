Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is not a direct quote of the original answer (MV 'Em gái mưa' của Hương Tràm được sản xuất bởi Alien Media), it still provides relevant information related to the topic. The generated answer correctly identifies the unknown variable in the generated question (Alien Media sản xuất MV cho ca sĩ nào?) and provides a neutral response stating that there is no available information. This is consistent with the original answer, which does not provide a direct answer to the generated question but instead mentions a specific MV album produced by Alien Media."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not exactly the same as the original answer, but it still provides partially relevant information. The generated answer mentions that the music video was done by an êkíp (team) for Hương Tràm, which is correct, but it does not specify the exact production company 'Alien Media' as stated in the original answer. The answer is not entirely irrelevant because it still relates to the music video and its production team, but it lacks specificity and accuracy compared to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately conveys the reason for Darmian's desire to leave Manchester United and mentions the same specific events (trading times of ups and downs, losing his position to Valencia) as the original answer, showing a strong similarity in context and content."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly relevant because it touches on the same topic of Darmian's recent struggles at Manchester United, which is also mentioned in the original answer.

NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not relate to the original answer's discussion of Darmian's desire to leave Manchester United and join Juventus due to a lack of playing time, but instead talks about Juventus' perspective on replacing Dani Alves with Darmian at a different position. This is a completely different context and topic, and therefore is considered non-relevant."
