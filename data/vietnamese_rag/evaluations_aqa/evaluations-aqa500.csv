Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a relevant explanation for the relationship between currency and the issuance of gold bonds. While it does not exactly replicate the original answer, it accurately captures the main idea and provides additional context to support its claim. The generated answer also uses similar language and structures as the original answer, which suggests that the RAG system has successfully captured the underlying concepts."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it is a partial quote of the original text, focusing on the same topic of trái phiếu ngoại tệ (foreign currency bond) and its relationship to the government's plan. However, it lacks the additional context and details provided in the original answer, making it only partly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a partial duplication of the original answer. While it correctly identifies the entity responsible for approving the plan (Thủ tướng Chính phủ), it lacks the crucial information about the plan being related to the issuance of foreign currency government bonds (trái phiếu ngoại tệ). The generated answer only answers a part of the original question, whereas the original answer provides more information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by mentioning a place where the foreign currency bond is traded, which is correct. However, it does not provide the complete information mentioned in the original answer, which is the market where the bond is traded based on the plan approved by the Prime Minister. The generated answer only provides a partial answer, which is relevant to the question, but not entirely relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it repeats the same information mentioned in the original answer, specifically about the types of complaints that the Chief Justice of the Supreme People's Court has the authority to handle. However, the repetition is not a direct quote, and the language used is not identical, which reduces the relevance score."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it directly paraphrases and summarizes the original text, indicating a strong understanding of the content. Although the generated answer is not an exact replica of the original, it conveys the same information and concept."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original question, but the response is not entirely accurate. It correctly mentions that the Chánh án Tòa án nhân dân cấp cao has the authority to resolve complaints, but incorrectly assumes that the 'do đối tượng nào thuộc quyền quản lý của người Chánh án Tòa án nhân dân cấp cao' is a question seeking to identify the objects under the supervision of the Chánh án Tòa án nhân dân cấp cao. Instead, the original answer explicitly states that the objects under supervision are công chức và người lao động. The generated answer would be more accurate if it provided a direct answer to the original question, rather than restating the question itself."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the essence of the original answer, stating the types of entities that Chánh án Tòa án nhân dân cấp cao settles disputes for (mình, công chức, and người lao động thuộc quyền quản lý của Chánh án Tòa án nhân dân cấp cao). However, it lacks the broader context of Chánh án Tòa án nhân dân cấp cao having the authority to resolve appeals on decisions and actions, which is the primary focus of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it provides the same fine range (10.000.000 VND to 20.000.000 VND) as a penalty for a specific scenario (receiving a business license from a foreign country without a confirmation document). The generated answer elaborates on the original answer by providing more context, which makes it highly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, suggesting a strong relevance. The context and content of the generated answer match the original answer in terms of format, numbers, and wording. The generated answer is a direct copy of the original answer, which indicates a high degree of similarity and relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it discusses the specific fine for violating the regulations on receiving franchising rights, but the fine range mentioned is different from the original answer (10,000,000 - 20,000,000 dong instead of 3,000,000 - 5,000,000 dong). The generated answer still answers the question partially correctly but provides a different and incomplete representation of the information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a specific figure (20,000,000 đồng) related to the maximum fine, which is also present in the original answer (Phạt từ 10,000,000 đồng đến 20,000,000 đồng). Although the wording is slightly different, the generated answer is accurate and relevant to the original answer, providing a direct answer to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely identical to the original answer, with the same range of fines specified for the same situation (individuals or organizations receiving postal rights from foreign countries without proof). The answer accurately conveys the same information as the original answer, demonstrating a high relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer includes most of the key points mentioned in the original answer, such as the benefits of using library, scientific documents, and laboratory to learn and conduct research. Additionally, the generated answer also includes the benefits of receiving scholarships and other allowances during study, receiving protective equipment, and being allocated a residence at the hospital or training base. The only slight difference is that the generated answer adds an extra point about the possibility of being exempted from specialized skills assessment after graduating with excellent grades, which is not explicitly mentioned in the original answer. Overall, the generated answer is coherent and accurately summarizes the benefits of studying as a resident doctor, and is therefore relevant to the original answer."
