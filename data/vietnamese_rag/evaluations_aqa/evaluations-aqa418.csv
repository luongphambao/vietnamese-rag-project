Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides the correct information that a 5-seat car can carry a maximum of 4 people, including the driver. The generated question and answer are essentially rephrasing the original answer in a different way, but the content and context are identical. The generated answer is essentially a paraphrased version of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct translation of the original answer, which is the same Vietnamese sentence. Although the question is in French and the format is different, the information provided in the answer is identical to the original, making it highly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, with only minor wording differences. Both answers state the same information about the maximum number of people allowed on a 5-seat vehicle, making it a relevant response."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer in terms of content and structure. Both answers mention the same key points, including the fact that the support is implemented based on the regulations of the committee. The only difference is that the generated answer is slightly more concise, but still conveys the same information."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer. The original answer explains how the compensation money received by the state for recovered public land is used, whereas the generated answer talks about the unclear procedure for the use of compensation money received by the landowner. The two topics are unrelated, and the generated answer does not provide a correct or logical explanation for the original question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by mentioning the relevant entity (Ủy ban nhân dân cấp tỉnh) and hinting at the calculation method of the compensation. However, it provides more specific details about the calculation process, including the consideration of land use rights and the possibility of communal compensation, which is not mentioned in the original answer. The tone and structure of the generated answer differ from the original, making it only partly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially corresponds to the original answer by mentioning 'tiền hỗ trợ' (support money) and the purpose of its allocation, namely 'đất công ích' (public land). However, the precision and granularity of the information are not accurate. The original answer specifically states that the support money is invested in infrastructure construction for public purposes, whereas the generated answer only states that it is allocated to 'Quỹ đất' (Land Fund), which is not a correct or detailed description."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, as it rephrases the same content and includes the same key points. The only difference is the rephrase of the question into an answer format, which does not affect the relevance of the generated content. The generated answer accurately conveys the same information as the original answer and is relevant to the original context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the original answer, restating the two conditions under which the plaintiff (nguyên đơn) is considered to have withdrawn the lawsuit.

RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, providing the same information about the circumstances under which the court can continue to resolve the dispute even if the plaintiff is absent.

Overall, the generated answer conveys the same meaning and idea as the original answer, and its relevance is considered 'RELEVANT'."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer. Both answers mention that if the plaintiff (nguyên đơn) is absent without a valid reason, the lawsuit (đơn kiện) will be considered as withdrawn. However, the generated answer is missing the detail about the court (Hội đồng trọng tài) continuing to resolve the dispute if the respondent (bị đơn) requests or files a counter lawsuit. Additionally, the generated answer does not provide the exact phrase 'được coi là đã rút đơn khởi kiện' (is considered as having withdrawn the lawsuit) as in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content and context. Both answers discuss the consequences of the plaintiff's absence from a court session. However, the generated answer is more focused on who makes the decision regarding continuing or postponing the trial, whereas the original answer explains the implications of the plaintiff's absence on the lawsuit. The generated answer's relevance is partly relevant because it still addresses a related issue, but it misses some crucial context and information present in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, providing the same percentage limits (5%) for product, service, and construction projects. The answer is relevant because it accurately references the same numbers and provides a direct comparison between products/services and construction projects."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer, as it acknowledges the existence of a budget for construction project warranty, which is a key point in the original answer. However, the generated answer diverges significantly from the original answer, providing a detailed breakdown of calculation components whereas the original answer is more focused on the maximum percentage value. The generated answer also adds new information about the parties involved in submitting reports and the timing of warranty completion, which is not present in the original answer."
