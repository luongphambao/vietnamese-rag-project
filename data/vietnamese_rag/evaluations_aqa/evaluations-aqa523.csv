Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, providing the exact same information about the procedure for receiving documents sent by postal mail. The only difference is in the wording, but the content is identical."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a different context and information unrelated to the original answer. The original answer mentions the regulation on electronic document reception in the financial and tax field, whereas the generated answer provides an example of a specific context ( Bộ Giáo dục và Đào tạo) and its resources (website and email address), which is not relevant to the original question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question about what information needs to be recorded when receiving a decision or document by paper. However, it only mentions the date of receipt and the stamp of the tax agency, whereas the original answer provides a more comprehensive description of the information to be recorded, including the date of receipt, the stamp of the tax agency, and the file number of the agency."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content and context. While it mentions the electronic receipt of documents, it focuses on a specific decree ( Nghị định 126 năm 2020) and its requirements for tax decisions, which is not directly mentioned in the original answer. The original answer provides a more general framework for electronic document reception, whereas the generated answer is more specific and focused on a particular decree."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the content of the original answer. Both answers mention the need for the person on probation to report to a relevant authority when moving to a new residence. However, the original answer specifies the 'Công an cấp xã' (Police Department) while the generated answer mentions 'Phòng Cảnh sát huyện' (District Police Bureau). Additionally, the wording and syntax of the generated answer are similar but not identical to the original answer, which indicates some deviation in detail and phraseology."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer, providing the correct information that an individual who is being released on probation is required to report to the local police station when moving to a new residence."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information about the role of Công an cấp xã in managing people on probation. However, it only addresses a specific aspect (allowing people on probation to visit their family when there is a request and confirmation from the people's committee) and does not cover the full scope of the original answer, which mentions reporting to the Công an cấp xã and registering their temporary residence."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it addresses the same topic as the original answer, which is the restrictions on a person's movement after being placed on a suspended sentence. However, it does not match the original answer in terms of phrasing and accuracy. The generated answer states that people on suspended sentence 'can only leave their residence if they have a legitimate reason and must seek permission according to the regulations', while the original answer simply states that they need to report to the local police station when they change their residence. The generated answer also adds unnecessary information ('according to the regulations at paragraph 2 of the text') which is not present in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially agrees with the original answer. Both answers mention the requirement for a person on probation (án treo) to report to the police when moving to a new residence. However, the generated answer does not provide the additional context and detail provided in the original answer about the requirement to report to the police and the duration of the reporting requirement, which limits the relevance of the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it contains the same information about the punishment for importing a ship with technical specifications that do not match the permit. The generated answer mentions both the fine and the forced export of the ship, which are the same consequences described in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially covers the same topic as the original answer, mentioning the same penalty range and associated behavior. However, the original answer provides a broader context and additional information about the consequences of violating regulations, which is not present in the generated answer. The generated answer also rephrases the original answer's content, whereas the original answer provides new insights."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer specifically answers the generated question by providing the exact fine range (50,000,000 to 70,000,000 đồng) mentioned in the original answer, which is a direct response to the original information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a direct solution to the problem mentioned in the generated question, which is the same as the solution mentioned in the original answer. Although the generated answer is shorter and missing some details, its content is very similar to the original answer, and it accurately addresses the issue of what happens when importing a boat that does not meet the regulations."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer. The generated answer provides information about how the voluntary pension fund is separated from other main contract funds, which is similar to the original answer. However, it also provides additional information about the reporting requirements and the lock-up period, which is not mentioned in the original answer. While the generated answer is related to the topic, it does not fully align with the original answer, hence the relevance is not fully relevant."
