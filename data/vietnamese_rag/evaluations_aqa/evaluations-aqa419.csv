Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer contradicts the original answer. The original answer states that the limited maximum rate for setting aside provision for warranty is 5% of total revenue for products, services, and not more than 5% of the contract value for construction projects. The generated answer, however, states that there is no maximum limit, which is an opposite conclusion to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the relevant information by mentioning the topic of 'tỷ lệ dự phòng bảo hành đối với các công trình xây dựng' (provisional warranty rate for construction projects) and links it to the legal framework. However, the answer lacks specific details and numerical limits mentioned in the original answer, such as 'không quá 05%' (not exceeding 5%) and 'theo giá trị hợp đồng' (according to the contract value). Additionally, the presence of 'bunifuFlatButton' is unclear and likely unrelated to the topic."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer both in terms of content and format. The generated answer explicitly mentions the same information as the original answer, including the range of fine amounts from 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 VND for karaoke activities that exceed the allowed hours. The generated answer is verbatim to the original answer, which indicates high relevance between the two."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question and provides the same specific information as the original answer, namely the fine range for karaoke activities that exceed the permitted hours. The language and structure of the generated answer are also similar to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"While the generated answer does provide some information related to the original answer, it diverges significantly in its presentation and scope. The generated answer tries to infer the limit time for karaoke operation, which is not accurately reflected in the original answer. The original answer provides a specific fine range for karaoke operators, while the generated answer focuses on the unspecified limit time. Although it correctly refers to the original answer's statement about fines, the overall relevance is PARTLY_RELEVANT rather than RELEVANT due to the distinct differences in focus and presentation."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it provides the maximum fine for karaoke activities that exceed the allowed time. However, the generated answer does not mention the fine range (5,000,000 - 10,000,000 VND) provided in the original answer, which reduces its relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is almost identical to the original answer, with the same words and sentence structure.

However, the meaning and content of the generated answer remain the same and accurately describe the concept of temporarily transferring weapons, explosives, and supporting equipment between police units."

However, it does not directly answer the question about the duration of the transfer, which was the main focus of the question. The generated answer seems to deviate from the original answer, which provided a more specific description of the transfer process."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately restates the original answer, providing a direct response to the question.
