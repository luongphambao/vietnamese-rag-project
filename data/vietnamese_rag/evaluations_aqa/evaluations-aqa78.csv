RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately identifies the opponent of Real Madrid in the match where Cristiano Ronaldo scored two goals, which matches the original answer. The answer is a direct response to the generated question and conveys the same information as the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, with almost identical content and structure. It accurately addresses the question and provides the same reasons why sách ảnh is attractive to giới trẻ. The minor difference is the repetition of the last sentence in the original answer, which is not critical to the overall relevance of the answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially reflects the content of the original answer, mentioning the book's stories about a person with a disability conquering a mountain, a teenager's journey of discovery, and experiencing new things in a different culture. However, the generated answer lacks the overall context and main points of the original answer, which notes that the book's unique space is dedicated to images and is attractive to young readers because it conveys a lot of information quickly and is memorable. The generated answer also misses the broader themes and values of the book, such as being a valuable and practical guide for readers."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly relevant, as it touches on the same points as the original answer, such as the attractive aspect of books with images, the lack of imposition of the author's thoughts, and the educational value of the book. However, it is not entirely relevant as it lacks some points mentioned in the original answer, such as the 'không phải đọc nhiều mà vẫn biết nhiều và ngấm lâu hơn' (not needing to read much but still learning a lot and absorbing slowly) aspect, and the quote about sách ảnh being a 'cuốn cẩm nang giá trị và thiết thực đối với độc giả' (valuable and practical guide for readers). Additionally, the explanation in the generated answer is shorter and more concise compared to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially overlaps with the original answer in terms of content. Both answers mention the unique features of the book (không gian mới lạ), the use of images as a language, and the book's value in providing new experiences for readers.

The generated answer is more focused on the specific details of the altercation and does not provide a full summary of the event."
