Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the requirement for quality of life jackets on inland waterway passenger transport, but adds additional information that is not present in the original text. The generated answer mentions periodic inspection and maintenance, which is not mentioned in the original answer. Despite this, the generated answer still conveys the main requirement stated in the original answer, hence PARTLY_RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by providing a relevant piece of information about the storage location of life jackets on a river vehicle. However, the overall answer lacks detail and context, as it does not explicitly mention the requirement for life jackets to be stored in a designated and safe location, nor does it provide a clear explanation of the regulations for safe storage. The generated answer also does not provide a sufficient connection to the initial statement about the requirements for life jackets and personal flotation devices."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a similar range of fines (1.000.000 - 2.000.000 đồng) as mentioned in the original answer. However, it lacks the precise answer provided in the original answer, which is the exact fine range 'From 1.000.000 to 2.000.000'. The generated answer only answers part of the original answer, providing the lower bound of the fine range, but not the upper bound."

Although the format and wording are different, the generated answer conveys the same essential information as the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it addresses the same topic as the original answer, which is financial punishment. However, the specific range of the fine is not identical. The original answer mentions a range of 1.000.000 đồng to 2.000.000 đồng, while the generated answer says 800.000 đồng to 1.000.000đồng. Although they are close, the generated answer does not accurately represent the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer provides a fine range, the specific range (800,000-1,000,000 VND) is different from the original answer (1,000,000-2,000,000 VND). The generated answer only covers part of the range mentioned in the original answer, indicating partial relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original question, as it mentions the need to abide by regulations when parking a car on the road, which is related to the original answer's topic of fines for parking violations.

The generated answer also includes unrelated information about other types of fines, which reduces its relevance to the original answer."

NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer because it presents a different range of fines (<1,000,000 - 3,000,000 VND) compared to the original answer (8,000,000 - 10,000,000 VND). The context of the question and answer is also different, as the generated answer does not mention anything about the fine range being 'phạt tiền' (fine) in Vietnamese."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer in terms of range values (8.000.000 đồng to 10.000.000 đồng), covering the same information.

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions a fine range, which is similar to the original answer. However, the generated fine range is much higher than the original one.

Although they both talk about fines, the magnitude is different, indicating a partial relevance."

The original answer provides a range of 8-10 million dong for a specific fine, whereas the generated answer provides a much smaller range (400,000-600,000 dong) and is unclear about the specific fine type and context. The relevant information (related to the fine amount and context) is not preserved accurately in the generated answer."
