Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a simple copy of the original question, without providing any relevant information about the original answer. The original answer talks about the formation and management of voluntary retirement funds, while the generated answer is a question asking what the insured person contributes to the fund."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer, as it provides the same information and describes the activities related to the voluntary pension fund, including establishing, tracking, and accounting for the fund's income, expenses, assets, and capital separately from other funds."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is the same as the original question, whereas the original answer is a description of a pension fund and its management. The generated answer does not provide any relevant information about the management of the fund and is not a direct response to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, providing the same conditions for reducing the sentence term for an individual who is not under custody from 2020. The wording and structure are almost identical, indicating a high degree of relevance and accuracy."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it correctly mentions two additional cases for which the sentence can be reduced: người đã quá già yếu (aging offenders) and người bị bệnh hiểm nghèo (offenders with serious illnesses). However, it only mentions these two cases and does not summarize the original answer that mentions lập công (offenders who have achieved a certain level of reform) as an additional case. Additionally, the generated answer lacks the precise details mentioned in the original answer regarding the maximum reduction amount, the requirement for the offender's actual sentence to be two-fifths of the original sentence, etc."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately extracts the specific information mentioned in the original answer, which is the maximum reduction in time for prisoners not serving their sentence. The generated answer matches the original answer word-for-word, indicating a high degree of relevance and similarity."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is not identical to the original answer, it discusses the same topic and provides relevant information. The generated answer answers the generated question 'Có giới hạn nào về thời gian thực tế phải chấp hành sau khi xét giảm thời hạn án không?' and overlaps with the original answer. Both answers discuss the requirement for time served after being released early in addition to the specific requirements mentioned. However, the generated answer provides slightly different information on the detailed requirements."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the topic of reducing the sentence term for reformers who are not imprisoned since 2020. However, it provides a specific range of time (03 tháng - 09 tháng) for each reduction, which is not present in the original answer. The original answer focuses on the maximum reduction of 01 năm per term, and the total duration of the sentence remains unclear in the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly a repetition of the original answer, with minor adjustments to fit the specific context of the generated question. While it captures the main points and regulations, it does not provide any new or additional information, and the language is very similar to the original text."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions a specific organization (Ủy ban Chứng khoán Nhà nước) and authority (cho phép), which is not mentioned in the original answer. The original answer focuses on the general requirements for handling confidential documents, such as obtaining permission from the head of the unit, whereas the generated answer provides a specific example that does not align with the original context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions the importance of protecting state secrets, which is in line with the original answer's emphasis on secrecy and permission requirements. However, the generated answer does not directly address the question about which organizations are allowed to research state secrets, instead providing a broader discussion of the regulations and procedures for handling sensitive information. This departure from the original question's focus makes the answer less relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content, but it misses some key points. The original answer provides specific guidelines for handling and storing confidential state documents, while the generated answer focuses solely on the requirement to follow confidentiality regulations for documents that are made public. Although the question and generated answer share some similarities, they fail to capture the full scope of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses the training period for railway security personnel, which is partially relevant to the original answer 'Mỗi 03 năm một lần'. Although the answers are about training periods, they are not directly related in terms of frequency or time interval. The generated answer provides a more specific training period framework, whereas the original answer is a general statement. The connection is notable, but not strong enough to classify it as 'RELEVANT'."
