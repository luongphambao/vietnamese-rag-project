The generated answer does not provide any meaningful information related to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, providing the same information about when mothers typically start feeling fetal movements. The only difference is the addition of a separate sentence mentioning that some mothers may feel the movements earlier, from week 15-20. This additional information is present in the original text, so the generated answer is considered relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is directly addressing the question and providing relevant information about the earliest sense of fetal movement that expectant mothers can feel, which is consistent with the original answer.
