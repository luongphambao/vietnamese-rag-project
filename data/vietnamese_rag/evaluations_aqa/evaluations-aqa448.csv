Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not relate to the original answer. The original answer specifies the fine range for speeding between 10-20 km/h, but the generated answer provides a fine range for a different scenario, which is a difference in speed of 10-20 km/h, and the fine range is doubled. The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer's context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, as it provides the same information about the fine range for speeding a motorbike from 10 km/h to 20 km/h. The only difference is the question being asked in the generated answer, which is a minor alteration that did not affect the relevance of the information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer. Both answers mention the same range of speed (10-20 km/h) and the same fine range (600,000 - 1,000,000 VND). The generated answer is a paraphrased version of the original answer, using the same information and structure."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer. Both answers are describing the purpose of investigating the status of a mine, which is to determine the certain, reliable, and estimated quantities of resources and evaluate the development potential of the mine. The generated answer is a verbatim copy of the original answer, suggesting that the RAG system has successfully retrieved and generated an answer that is identical to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially touches on the same topic as the original answer, mentioning 'làm rõ hiện trạng tài nguyên' (clarifying resource status) and 'phát hiện mới về khoáng sản' (finding new mineral resources). However, the answer diverges from the original answer by only focusing on the significance of the survey results, whereas the original answer provides a broader explanation of what a survey entails. Additionally, the generated answer lacks key concepts mentioned in the original answer, such as 'tài nguyên chắc chắn, tin cậy' (certain and reliable resources) and 'đánh giá khả năng phát triển mỏ' (evaluating the potential for mine development)."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides information about the important data collected during the survey of the mine, which is closely related to the original answer's content. The original answer mentions 'Điều tra hiện trạng một khu mỏ là hoạt động làm rõ hiện trạng trữ lượng, tài nguyên chắc chắn, tin cậy; tài nguyên dự tính và đánh giá khả năng phát triển mỏ', which focuses on the survey process and the collecting of data. The generated answer specifically mentions 'khoáng chất, khoáng sản, trữ lượng khoáng sản, sự phân bố khoáng sản, kích thước, vị trí, tốc độ và hướng đi của các loại khoáng sản', which are all relevant data points collected during the survey process."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, indicating that the RAG system has successfully retrieved and generated a relevant response that accurately matches the original content."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly reproduces the list of units receiving guidance from the Văn phòng Ủy ban nhân dân cấp tỉnh, which is identical to the original answer. However, the generated answer does not provide additional information or insights that expand upon the original answer, making it only partly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by providing additional information on what institutions are being guided by Văn phòng Ủy ban nhân dân cấp tỉnh, besides Văn phòng các Sở. However, the generated answer does not match the original answer in its entirety, as it introduces some new information and rephrases the original answer. The original answer provides a general overview of Văn phòng Ủy ban nhân dân cấp tỉnh's responsibilities, while the generated answer focuses on a specific aspect of those responsibilities."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it rephrases the same information as the original answer, but does not provide any new or additional information. The structure and content are very similar, but the generated answer is essentially a copy-paste of the original answer, without any clear added value or explanation."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer by mentioning specific groups of people (Uỷ ban nhân dân cấp huyện and Uỷ ban nhân dân cấp xã) that receive guidance from Văn phòng Ủy ban nhân dân cấp tỉnh. However, it does not fully capture the scope and responsibilities of Văn phòng ỨXem committee highlighted in the original answer, which implies a broader guidance role."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content. Both answers mention the specific regulation (Mục A-III/7 of Bộ luật STCW) and list the technical requirements (e.g., electrical, electronics, control technology, maintenance, repair, supervision). However, the generated answer includes additional information (the exact functions with assistance levels), which is not present in the original answer. The relevance is PARTLY_RELEVANT because the generated answer captures the main point of the original answer but also adds extraneous details."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, word-for-word. It provides the same information and includes the same specific functions required for a marine electrician as stated in Mục A-III/7 of the Bộ luật STCW."
