The generated answer also answers the specific question asked, making it relevant and useful."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately reports the incident of Rooney being punched in the face by Simon Francis during a match, which is the same information provided in the original answer. The answer includes the correct team names, 'Bournemouth', and the specific detail of Rooney being punched in the face, matching the original answer's content and context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately mentions the location where Rooney was injured (mặt, or face) after being struck by Simon Francis, which is a specific detail mentioned in the original answer. Although the original answer provides more context and information, the generated answer is still relevant to the original answer and addresses the main question of where Rooney was injured."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, accurately describing the consequences of Rooney being struck in the face by Francis, including the bleeding and Rooney's anger. The generated answer also mentions the referee's failure to punish Francis, which is consistent with the original answer. Although the generated answer is not a direct copy of the original answer, it retains the key information and events, making it relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains the same information as the original answer, including the details of the incident and Rooney's reason for leaving the field. The answer repeats the same phrase 'đánh cùi chỏ trúng mặt' and 'phá tranh chấp bóng bổng' to explain the cause of Rooney's injury. The answer is essentially a rewritten version of the original answer, providing the same information in a slightly modified format."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it matches the exact wording and numbers in the original answer. However, the context and focus of the original answer are different. The original answer provides information about Triều Tiên's retrieval of documents, while the generated question and answer are focused on the retrieval of military data from the US and South Korea. Although the answers share some similarities, they are not directly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant to the original answer because it mentions the same number of gigabytes (230) and the same percentage (around 80%) of unknown content. However, the generated answer incorrectly states that it was both North Korea and the US that lost the data, whereas the original answer actually says that North Korea gained the data."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer. The percentage and the total amount of data retrieved are mentioned in both answers ('nhiều hơn 230 gigabyte tài liệu' and 'nhiều hơn 230 gigabyte tài liệu quân sự'). The generated answer also maintains the same tone and context as the original answer, focusing on secret military data. The only difference is that the generated answer adds the adjective 'bí mật' to emphasize the secrecy of the data, which does not significantly alter the relevance of the answer to the original."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it directly quotes and paraphrases the original information about 80% of the content being unknown. The generated answer is a precise response to the generated question, mirroring the content of the original answer with minimal changes, indicating a high degree of similarity and relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer as it conveys a similar idea, i.e., North Korea's intentions to attack. However, the tone and language used are different, and the generated answer lacks specific details and concrete examples provided in the original answer. The generated answer also includes a question in the beginning which is not present in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information, such as Triều Tiên's potential use of biological and chemical weapons, the potential devastating consequences of a military attack, and the North Korean government's stance on not being willing to give up its nuclear program. However, the generated answer does not directly answer the original question, which asks about specific circumstances under which Triều Tiên would launch an attack. Instead, it provides additional context and information that is somewhat related to the topic. While some of the information is relevant, it is not directly addressing the original question and is therefore only PARTLY_RELEVANT."
