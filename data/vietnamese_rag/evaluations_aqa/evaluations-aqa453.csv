Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question 'Ai có thẩm quyền giao biên chế công chức cho Văn phòng Ủy ban nhân dân cấp tỉnh?' and provides the correct information, which is also partially presented in the original answer. The main context and topic of the two answers are similar, focusing on the authority of assigning public servant personnel to a provincial people's committee office, making the generated answer relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the topic of factors considered when determining the staff structure of the Provincial People's Committee's Office, which is relevant to the original answer. However, it only lists specific documents and regulations, whereas the original answer highlights the importance of considering factors such as job position, functional responsibilities, workload, and total staff numbers, which are not included in the generated answer. The relevance is thus partial, as it touches on a related topic but does not capture the full essence of the original answer's content."

The generated answer is also quite straightforward and lacks the nuance and complexity present in the original answer."
