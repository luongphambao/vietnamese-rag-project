Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it mentions the exact same number of days ('hai ngày', which means two days) as the original answer. Although the context is different (the generated answer is part of a specific regulation or provision) and there is no direct quote of the original answer, the numerical value is the same, indicating a high level of relevance."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer provides additional context about the team and the tournament, it closely matches the original answer 'Chỉ có vỏn vẹn hai ngày nghỉ' in terms of the number of days, which is the primary information the original answer conveys."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer acknowledges that the provided context does not contain information about the time off for footballers after an international tournament, which is partially relevant to the original answer. The original answer specifically mentions 'hai ngày nghỉ' (two days off), but the generated answer does not address this specific information. While it provides a relevant response in that it does not have the information requested, it does not directly address the original answer or provide a relevant answer to the generated question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is closely related to the original answer in terms of both content and context. The original answer 'Chỉ có vỏn vẹn hai ngày nghỉ' is about the number of days off, and the generated answer 'Sau World Cup, các cầu thủ được nghỉ ngơi vỏn vẹn hai ngày' also provides this information. The only difference is that the generated answer is a response to a specific question, whereas the original answer is a standalone statement. This minor difference does not affect the relevance of the generated answer to the original one."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer because it mentions the concept of 'chính phủ quy định' (government regulation), which is related to the original answer 'Chỉ có vỏn vẹn hai ngày nghỉ' (only two days off). However, the generated answer does not directly address the original answer's content, which is the duration of the break, and instead provides a negative statement that no information is available on the government's regulation on this matter, making it only partially relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, sharing the same context, content, and structure. The only difference is that the generated answer is a response to a question, while the original answer appears as a standalone statement. The similarity in content and context indicates high relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer, as it contains the same information and context. The only difference is the rephrasing of the sentence, but the content and meaning remain the same."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it mentions the UAE, which is mentioned in the original answer. However, the precise information about the statement being made is different, with the original answer mentioning Gargash, the Foreign Minister of UAE, while the generated answer does not specify who made the statement. The generated answer also provides specific date information which is not present in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it mentions 'bổ sung biện pháp trừng phạt' which matches with the original answer, indicating that the UAE foreign minister mentioned additional measures being discussed to punish Doha. However, the generated answer only partially addresses the question and lacks concrete information about the actions planned by the Arab countries, falling short of fully capturing the original answer's context and content."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is the same as the original answer, which is the title of a report. The generated question, on the other hand, is asking about the ranking of a country in a report, which is a different topic and context from the original answer. The generated answer does not address the query at all, making it non-relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the safety rating of Vietnam according to the Underwriters Laboratories report, which is exactly what the generated question is asking. The answer is a direct quote from the report and contains the same information as the original answer. The only difference is the slight variation in wording, but the content and context are extremely similar."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it mentions Underwriters Laboratories (UL) indirectly by discussing a safety index (62/100 points) for a country (Vietnam) but doesn't provide the intended safety report (UL's report). The question was about a specific topic unrelated to the original answer, which is a safety report from Underwriters Laboratories."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated question is different from the original question, the generated answer is directly related to the original answer. The generated answer still provides information about the Underwriters Laboratories' report on safety specifications, which matches the context of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer acknowledges the lack of information about the areas that are evaluated in the Underwriters Laboratories report, which is relevant to the original answer. The original answer is a report about Underwriters Laboratories' safety standards, so the generated answer's response to the question about areas evaluated is relevant to that context."
