Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a paraphrased version of the original answer, providing similar information about the weather forecast for the day, including the possibility of rain showers and thunderstorms. Although it does not answer the original question directly, it provides relevant information that is related to the question, making it a relevant answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it accurately extracts specific information about the weather conditions during the evening and night, which is also mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer mentions 'chiều tối và đêm có mưa vừa' which is a direct quote from the original answer. The only minor difference is the inclusion of 'có nơi mưa to và rải rác có dông' which is also mentioned in the original answer but not exactly in the same format."

The generated question asked about humidity percentage, but the answer provided does not mention humidity or percentage, instead stating that there is no information about humidity in the text."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is about the predicted high temperature, whereas the original answer is about the weather forecast, mentioning low temperature, rain, and wind. The content and context of the two answers are unrelated and mismatched."
PARTELY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of context and key points, but lacks some details and tone. Specifically, the generated answer only mentions the situation in the Korean Peninsula and the purpose of the convergence, while the original answer provides more specific information about the situation, the involvement of multiple US aircraft carriers, and the American message towards China. The generated answer also seems to be more concise and direct, whereas the original answer provides more context and nuance. Overall, the generated answer captures some important aspects of the original answer, but falls short in terms of depth and complexity."

Therefore, the generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, covering the same key points: the reason for deploying the USS Nimitz, the crisis situation in the Korean Peninsula, and the message sent to China to increase cooperation with the US on the Korean issue.
