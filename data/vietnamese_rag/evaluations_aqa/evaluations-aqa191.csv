Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer because it shifts the focus to a different context (Honda CR-V 2018) and provides a general price range for a higher trim level, which is not mentioned in the original answer. The original answer is specific to a particular model (Honda CR-V 2.4L) and promotion period, and the generated answer does not provide a direct answer to the question of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer in terms of the location (Quảng trường Đỏ) and the date (22/7), which are the key information needed to answer the question. The answer provided also has a similar structure to the original answer, which adds to its relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately extracts the information about the uninterrupted training time for setting the Guinness record, which is mentioned in the original answer. The answer provides the same information as the original answer, only in a concise manner."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the context of the original question, but the details do not exactly match. The generated answer mentions the Guinness representatives as the ones who guaranteed the independence and impartiality, whereas the original answer does not specify the location (Moscow) and date (22/7) of the event. While the core idea is similar, the specificities provided in the generated answer are not present in the original answer, making it PARTLY_RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer does not exactly match the original answer, it does mention the same event (va chạm xe máy) and provides a specific name (ông Đặng Đức H.) as the person injured. However, the original answer states that Ngô Hoài Hận was the one who deceased, whereas the generated answer mentions someone else. Therefore, while the answer is partially relevant, it does not capture the core information of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer as it also talks about the traffic accident and one of the victims. However, it provides additional details that are not present in the original answer, such as the location and another victim's name, which deviates from the original answer's focus on Ngô Hoài Hận's death."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it directly contradicts the original statement, which implies that the answer is aware of the original information and provides an opposing perspective. Although the statement is just a denial of involvement ('Ngô Hoài Hận không có quan hệ với vụ việc'), it is still related to the original topic and the original statement."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer describes a different scene and event, whereas the original answer mentions Ngô Hoài Hận's death in a motorbike accident-related fight. The generated answer does not relate to the topic or context of the original answer, making it non-relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant to the original answer because it discusses the impact of a fire on the safety of workers, which is mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer is not directly addressing the statement 'Không, vụ việc không gây thiệt hại về người' (No, the incident did not cause harm to people) and instead presents examples of fires that did cause harm to people. The generated answer provides some related information, but it does not directly address the original statement."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information, specifically mentioning that people were injured in certain incidents (e.g., the explosion at Mr. H.'s house, the fire at PouYuen's cafeteria, and the fire in Hawaii). However, these examples are not directly related to the original answer's statement that there was no harm to people in the event, and instead present alternative scenarios where people did get injured. This makes the generated answer only partly relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions the extent of the damage caused by the fire, which is related to the original answer's statement that there is no human injury. However, the generated answer also introduces new information about the location of the fire (PouYuen company) and the impact on the workers, whereas the original answer only focuses on no human injury, making it partially relevant but not fully matching the intent of the original answer."
