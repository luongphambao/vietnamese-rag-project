PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question, providing a range of fine (30 phút - 200 xe) and a correction (phạt tiền từ 30.000.000 đồng đến 40.000.000 đồng). However, it does not fully explain the answer, as the original answer only mentioned a fine range and not a specific waiting time range."
