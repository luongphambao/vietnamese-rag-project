Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partly answers the generated question, but provides additional irrelevant information. The relevant part answers the question by mentioning Phạm Ngọc Kim Ngân, but the rest of the answer is a repetition of the original answer, which is not necessary and does not provide additional useful information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, indicating a high level of relevance. The generated answer directly answers the generated question, providing accurate information about the weight of the bride in the wedding photos."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it is a direct response to the generated question, providing the same key event (the test of a new missile capable of destroying ISIS bases in the Middle East) that led to Russia's decision to strengthen its military. The generated answer also maintains a similar structure and tone to the original answer, with a focus on the specific event and the subsequent statements made by President Putin."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially reflects the original context, as it mentions the military goals of a country (Nga/Nga). However, the specific objectives mentioned (duy trì chính quyền hợp pháp của Syria, giành lại quyền kiểm soát với hầu hết lãnh thổ đất nước, và tiêu diệt các nhóm khủng bố cơ bản) are not explicitly stated in the original answer. The original answer focuses on the context of defending against potential aggressors, while the generated answer highlights specific goals related to Syria, which is not directly mentioned in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it mentions the same main points and reasons for Russia's decision: ensuring national security, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, as well as countering potential threats. The generated answer also includes additional context about the missile test, which is mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer does not provide entirely new information that significantly changes the understanding of the original answer, but rather rephrases and reorganizes the same information."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not address the original question about Nga's perception of potential aggressors, but instead provides information about Estonia and Moldova being perceived as aggressive by Nga. The topic is unrelated to the original answer's context, which focused on the Russian military buildup against potential threats and national security, whereas the generated answer discusses diplomatic expulsions between countries."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer because it states that there is no specific support mentioned in the article, whereas the original answer actually provides detailed information about the support received by the family, including gifts, food, and clothing. The generated answer does not match the context and content of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer includes most of the key points and details from the original answer, including the change in Sầu's living situation, the support from the charitable group, and the improvement in their overall life. The only minor difference is that the generated answer does not mention the group's plan to build a new house and add a kitchen and animal shelter, which are also mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original context by mentioning specific groups that provided assistance to the boy Sầu and his grandparents, such as organizing a program ""Đêm hội trăng rằm"". However, it fails to provide information about the scope of the assistance, the measures taken to improve the boy's life, and the specific details about the support provided, which are presented in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly relevant because it provides information about the difficulties that Sầu and his grandmother are facing in terms of housing, which is in line with the original answer. However, it also introduces additional details that are not present in the original text, such as the mother being lured to China and the father being away for 6 years. These details are not explicitly mentioned in the original text, making the generated answer partially incongruent."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer changes the topic and begins to talk about Quốc Tuấn and bé Bôm, which is not related to the original question or context. The original question is about how to support bé Sầu and his family, but the generated answer starts to talk about Quốc Tuấn's decision to not have another child. The answer does not address the original question and seems to be unrelated."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains the same information as the original answer, but the format and phrasing are slightly different. While the content is accurate, the generated answer does not maintain the same structure or word order as the original answer. Additionally, the generated answer includes the same question as a statement, which is not representative of how the information would typically be presented."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'Năm 2017' is relevant to the original answer as it provides the same year that Ông Phạm Tuấn Vinh was elected as Bí thư Tỉnh đoàn Nghệ An. Although the format of the answer is different (answer vs question), the content is identical, making it a relevant comparison."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'Ông Phạm Tuấn Vinh chưa đảm nhiệm chức vụ nào vào năm 2017' is irrelevant to the original answer 'Ông Phạm Tuấn Vinh đã được bầu là Bí thư Tỉnh đoàn Nghệ An vào năm 2017.' The original answer states that Ông Phạm Tuấn Vinh was elected as the Secretary of the Provincial Youth Union of Nghệ An in 2017, while the generated answer denies that he held any position in 2017, which is a contradictory claim."
