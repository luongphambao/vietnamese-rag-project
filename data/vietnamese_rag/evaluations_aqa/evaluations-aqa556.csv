Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question of who is responsible for making a construction project schedule, but it does not directly answer the question. The answer provides some context about the project management process and refers to specific regulations, which is partially relevant to the original answer's emphasis on the contractor's responsibility to create a construction project schedule that aligns with the project's timeline. However, the answer does not explicitly state who is responsible for making the schedule, making it less relevant than the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially covers the same topics as the original answer, namely the importance of compatibility and planning during construction. However, the scope and precision of the generated answer are not entirely aligned with the original answer. The original answer provided a more specific focus on concurrent acceptance of project schedules by the general contractor and investor, which is not explicitly mentioned in the generated answer. The generated answer also introduces additional points, such as the importance of continuous working pace, which are not mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer by mentioning the role of Cục Hàng hải Việt Nam in the project, which is similar to the original answer's mention of the agency's role in approving the main contractor. However, the generated answer is more focused on the agency's role in project implementation and collaboration with other authorities, whereas the original answer goes into more detail about the agency's responsibility in evaluating and approving contractors. The relevance is partially because the generated answer touches on the same agency, but the context and scope are different."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information, specifically the mention of 'hạng mục công việc' (project scope), 'khối lượng công việc' (quantity of work), 'giá thi công' (contract price), 'tiến độ thi công' (project timeline), 'điều kiện hoàn thành công việc' (completion conditions), and 'trách nhiệm và quyền hạn của các bên tham gia hợp đồng' (responsibilities and rights of the parties involved). However, the generated answer focuses more on the specific details of the contract, whereas the original answer provides a comprehensive overview of the procurement process. The generated answer does not fully capture the context and scope of the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not provide a specific task or activity that the company needs to perform after signing the contract with the appointed contractor, whereas the original answer provides a detailed process for selecting and appointing a contractor. The generated answer broadly mentions following law regulations, contract, and professional ethics, which is not directly related to the question and original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it directly answers the question and provides specific information about what the agency can resolve. It even mentions 'quyết định, hành vi của mình, của công chức và người lao động thuộc quyền quản lý của Viện trưởng Viện kiểm sát nhân dân cấp huyện', which is partially mentioned in the original answer. However, it does not provide as much detail as the original answer and focuses only on the scope of the agency's authority, rather than the entire process of handling appeals."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses the issue of who has the authority to resolve appeals against the decisions of the People's Procuracy's provincial-level Chief Prosecutor, but fails to provide a clear answer. Although it mentions the lack of specific regulations for the provincial-level Chief Prosecutor, it does not address the original question directly. The generated answer focuses more on the general law and the mechanism of dispute resolution, rather than providing a specific answer to the question about the authorized person."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it correctly mentions that the decision of the Chief Prosecutor or equivalent has the effect of execution. However, the original answer provides more detailed information about the specific situations and hierarchy of resolution, which is not present in the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions some relevant information about the competence of the cadres in the prosecution agency to receive complaints, which is consistent with the original answer. However, it diverges by introducing additional actors (Chủ tịch Ủy ban nhân dân cấp xã, Ủy ban nhân dân cấp xã) and specific examples (quyết định, hành vi trái pháp luật của Chủ tịch Ủy ban nhân dân cấp xã, Ủy ban nhân dân cấp xã được Tòa án giao giám sát, giáo dục đối với người chấp hành án), which are not present in the original answer and do not fully capture the original text's intent."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of scope (it also mentions the resolution of complaints) and chain of command (it mentions a hierarchical resolution of complaints). However, it diverges in specifying the type of complainant (victims at the military court, instead of victims of decisions or acts violating the law by those managing prisoners) and the specific resolution authority. Overall, the generated answer captures some relevant information, but it lacks precision and detail compared to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer has a high degree of relevance to the original answer as it accurately summarizes the key responsibilities of the investor (chủ đầu tư) in the process of building a private house, including organizing and supervising the construction, ensuring safety, and keeping records as per regulations. The structure and content of the generated answer are very similar to that of the original answer, with some minor rephrasing, which indicates a high degree of relevance."
