Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it accurately summarizes the content and context. The original answer mentions Recep Tayyip Erdogan's reaction to the US's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the potential consequences for the Middle East. The generated answer, while concise, accurately reflects this sentiment, stating that the recognition will lead to a new conflict in the region."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant as it mentions the term 'một quả bom' used by Binali Yildirim, which is a key point in the original answer. However, the generated answer is not entirely relevant as it does not provide the full context of Binali Yildirim's statement, which was about the impact of the US decision on the Middle East region. The generated answer also lacks the additional context and quotes from Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the description of Palestinian suffering."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly accurate and relevant to the original answer. It correctly states that Hoàng Bách wanted to complete two tasks before he couldn't sing anymore, which matches the original answer. However, the generated answer is a direct summary of the original answer and lacks additional context or insights. Hence, it is not considered completely relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question and provides a relevant response by mentioning Việt Anh as the other artist whose songs Hoàng Bách wants to sing in the album. The answer is identical to one of the sentences in the original answer, indicating a high level of relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly similar to the original answer. The main event described in both answers is Hoàng Bách's desire to complete two things before he can't sing anymore, which is to sing his own songs and Việt Anh's songs. The explanations for this event are also similar, emphasizing the importance of completing these tasks for Hoàng Bách. The only minor difference is that the generated answer does not mention the album being a product of realizing a dream and having a beautiful memory with Việt Anh, which are key points in the original answer. However, the core idea of the reasons behind the album's creation is accurately captured in the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the exact same information about the match outcomes between Vietnam U23 and Korea, Australia, and Syria in the 2018 U23 Asian Cup. The only difference is the rephrased question, which does not affect the relevance of the answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the correct information about the number of goals scored by U23 Vietnam in the match against Syria at the 2018 U23 Asian Cup, which is consistent with the original answer. Although the generated answer does not provide the same level of detail as the original answer, it still conveys the same information and is relevant to the original prompt."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it provides a correct match for a specific match result mentioned in the original answer. However, it only mentions one specific match result (Vietnam winning 1-0) whereas the original answer provides information about multiple matches, including the loss to Korea, the win over Syria, and the draw with Australia. The generated answer lacks the contextual information present in the original answer, making it only partially relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer, mentioning that Đội tuyển U23 Việt Nam won against Syria, which is correct.

However, the original answer provided more information about the team's performances in the tournament, including a win against Syria and a loss to South Korea, which is not mentioned in the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a specific percentage (35%) which is also mentioned in the original answer. However, the format of the answer is different, as the original answer is a statement describing the target ratio until 2020, while the generated answer is a direct answer to the question. Additionally, the generated question and answer pair do not fully replicate the original statement, which makes it partly relevant rather than fully relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely relevant to the original answer as it provides a specific statistic (90% of ethnic minority children can speak Vietnamese by the time they enroll in preschool) and reiterates the specific target by 2020 (at least 35% of ethnic minority children in kindergarten and 90% in primary school, with 100% in preschool receiving Vietnamese language support). The generated answer closely mirrors the original answer in terms of content and context, with some rephrasing and additional information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, which is a specific goal for 2020. The generated answer correctly summarizes the target population (độ tuổi nhà trẻ and mẫu giáo) and their corresponding targets (35% and 90%) for using Vietnamese language. The only difference is the inclusion of the phrase 'Kết quả cụ thể là' (specific goal is) which is minor and does not affect the overall relevance."
