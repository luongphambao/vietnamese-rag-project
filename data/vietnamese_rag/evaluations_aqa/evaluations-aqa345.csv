RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer only mentions the 'cuối năm nay' (end of the year) timing for the project, it is directly related to the original answer's mention of 'dự kiến bàn giao thô cho khách hàng cuối năm nay' (expected to hand over to customers by the end of the year). The generated answer's content is relevant and accurately answers the generated question, making it relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately mentions the planned completion date of the project, which is mentioned in the original answer. Although the original answer provides more detailed information about the project's schedule, the generated answer correctly captures the relevant piece of information."
