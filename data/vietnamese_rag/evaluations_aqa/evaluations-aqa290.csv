Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly relevant to the original answer, as it includes similar information and context, but it seems to be a duplication of the original answer without adding new insights. The generated answer includes the same sentences and phrases as the original answer, which makes it relevant but not particularly valuable in terms of providing new information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content. The main point of the original answer ('OnePlus thu thập thông tin người dùng trên smartphone chạy OxygenOS để hoàn thiện nền tảng OxygenOS và hiểu hơn hành vi của người dùng máy') is present in the generated answer, but it is fragmented and mixed with unnecessary characters ('ughs ëng ìu...'), which reduces its relevance and makes it difficult to determine the actual purpose of OnePlus's data collection."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer, including the specific time frame ('cuối tháng 10/2017') and the scope of all smartphones running OxygenOS."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is a rephrase of the original question, the core information and context are the same, and it correctly answers the question about OxygenOS being used by OnePlus on mobile devices."
RELEVANT,The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it directly answers the generated question and provides similar details about the demonstration of the pioneering spirit of Liên chi Đoàn TNCS Hồ Chí Minh at ĐHQG Lào during 2015-2017.
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately reproduces a sentence from the original answer, which discusses the improvement and strengthening of the relationship between Vietnamese and Lao students through youth activities. The generated answer maintains the same context, keywords, and sentence structure as the original, indicating a high degree of relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer seems to be a repetition of the original answer, as it is almost identical. While it matches the content and context of the original answer, it does not provide any additional information or new insights. The relevance is partly because it addresses the same topic and question, but it lacks originality and is essentially a copy."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a question which is the same as the one given in the task. It does not provide any relevant information related to the original answer which talks about Hiện Kỳ Duyên đã Nam tiến để lập nghiệp và tiếp tục việc học tập. Instead, it asks a new question about Kỳ Duyên's current location, which is unrelated to the original context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not entirely accurate, as it states that Kỳ Duyên does not have any activity after being crowned, whereas the original answer reveals that she 'đã Nam tiến để lập nghiệp và tiếp tục việc học tập', which implies that she is actively pursuing her career and education. However, the generated answer does acknowledge that there is no information about Kỳ Duyên in the provided contexts, which hints at a limited understanding of the context and an inability to provide accurate information. While the generated answer is not entirely irrelevant, it fails to accurately capture the essence of the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,The generated answer discusses Kỳ Duyên's education level but incorrectly states that she is pursuing elementary school level (Tiểu học) when the original answer mentions that she has advanced to university (Nam tiến để lập nghiệp và tiếp tục việc học tập).
