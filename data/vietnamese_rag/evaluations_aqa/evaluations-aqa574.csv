Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly responds to the generated question and contains similar information as the original answer, specifically about the procedure for adjusting the amplitude of price fluctuations. The only difference is that the generated answer is shorter and more concise, but still accurately conveys the same information as the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'Thông tin về việc điều chỉnh biên độ dao động giá cổ phiếu được công bố trên cổng thông tin điện tử của Ủy ban Chứng khoán Nhà nước.' is highly relevant to the original answer. The original answer mentions that the committee will decide and announce on its official website any adjustments to the trading range. The generated answer accurately extracts this information and provides the exact source of the announcement, which is the same as the original answer, strongly indicating relevance."
RELEVANT,The generated answer is relevant because it accurately extracts and summarizes the information from the original answer. The phrase 'trong trường hợp cần thiết để ổn định thị trường' matches the original sentence 'Trong trường hợp cần thiết để ổn định thị trường' and restates the condition under which the State Securities Commission can adjust the price fluctuation range.
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly mentions that the stock exchange plays a role in determining the amplitude of price fluctuations, but it misses the detail that the decision is made after being approved by the State Securities Commission. The generated answer also does not mention the market stabilization measure and the information publication on the State Securities Commission's electronic portal, which are present in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant as it mentions the correct agencies responsible for setting up the council, but the focus is on the council's establishment process and the answer does not provide direct relevance to the evaluation and assessment of mining closure plans as mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it mentions the correct reference of Nghị định số 158/2016/NĐ-CP and the correct provision at Điều 6 Thông tư số 45/2016/TT-BTNMT. However, the generated answer only addresses part of the original answer, which mentioned the establishment of Hội đồng thẩm định đề án đóng cửa mỏ khoáng sản as a whole, including its responsibilities, composition, and operation mode. The generated answer mainly duplicates and rephrases the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains relevant information about the activity of the council, specifically mentioning that it operates in a mode of part-time employment and voting through a peer evaluation form. While the generated answer is not a direct quote from the original answer, it captures the essential information and is coherent with the original text."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially rephrased from the original answer, providing the same information about the permanent organization of the council. The original sentence provides more context about the council's role, but the generated answer focuses on the specific question of who the permanent organization is. The answer is accurate and relevant to the original text, providing a direct response to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, with the same structure and content. The only difference is that the original answer is more general, talking about phiên tòa in general, while the generated answer specifically mentions phiên tòa xét xử vụ án hành chính. However, the core information and the main points are identical, making it a relevant answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, as it also discusses the possibility of continuing the trial with a substitute prosecution officer and the possibility of postponing the trial if there is no substitute prosecution officer present from the beginning. The language used is also very close, suggesting that the generated answer is a direct replica of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer does not exactly match the original answer, it correctly states the consequence of not having a substitute prosecutor participate in the trial from the beginning. The generated answer 'Tòa án vẫn tiến hành xét xử vắng mặt Kiểm sát viên' (The court will proceed with the trial in the absence of the prosecutor) is relevant to the original answer, which mentions that 'phiên tòa sẽ được hoãn' (the trial will be postponed) if no substitute prosecutor participates from the beginning. The generated answer is more concise and focuses on the consequence, which is in line with the original answer's message."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is directly addressing the same issue as the original answer, which is how to ensure the trial proceeds smoothly when the prosecutor is absent. The answer provides the same two possible scenarios as the original answer (judge replacement by a substitute prosecutor or postponing the trial) and even reformulates the first scenario slightly. The content is very similar and relevant, showing a good understanding of the original answer."
