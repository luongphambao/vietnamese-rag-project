Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original question, which asks who is responsible for supervising and inspecing the survey and mapping process. The generated answer mentions a 'Hội đồng tư vấn chuyên môn' (Expert Committee) being responsible for evaluating the cause of a severe reaction to vaccine use, which is unrelated to the original question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer, as it mentions the role of Ủy ban nhân dân cấp tỉnh, which is mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer focuses more on the responsibility of ensuring order and safety on the waterway, which is not directly mentioned in the original answer. The lack of mentioning the specific steps and parties involved in the project, as mentioned in the original answer, reduces the relevance of the generated answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not relate to the original answer, which discusses the process of selecting a contractor and handing over the work site for the excavation and maintenance of inland waterways. The generated answer appears to be a redundant re-statement of the original question, without providing any relevant information or context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly responds to the generated question, providing the same information as the original answer. It correctly states that the center will be fined from 10,000,000 VND to 15,000,000 VND if it does not meet the conditions when simulating theoretical exams."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer by mentioning 'Điều kiện để trung tâm sát hạch lái xe được xét đủ điều kiện' (Conditions for a driving test center to be considered qualified), which is a related topic. However, the generated answer lacks specific information about the conditions, whereas the original answer provides concrete details about the requirement. The generated answer is incomplete and does not fully address the query, which makes it partly relevant but not entirely relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately conveys the same information as the original answer, including the range of fines (10.000.000 to 15.000.000 đồng) for a driving school that does not ensure its computers meet the necessary conditions for testing. The only difference is that the original answer provides more context, while the generated answer is more concise and directly answers the question. Nonetheless, the content and context of the generated answer are highly similar to the original answer, making it relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches with the original answer in terms of the fine range, but the context and reason for the fine are incorrect. The original answer mentions that the training center has more than 50% of machines that do not meet the conditions for testing and will be fined, whereas the generated answer states that the center will be fined for moving the functional rooms without any mention of machine conditions. Although the fine range is the same, the context is different, hence, the evaluation is PARTLY_RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question of the regulation about the conditions for theoretical exams at a driving school. However, it does not specifically mention the penalty for not meeting the conditions as stated in the original answer, which is a significant part of the original information. The generated answer also seems to be focused on a different aspect, mentioning regulations for specific occupations and training programs, which is not directly related to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly relevant, as it mentions the same concept of a fine for a specific behavior (receiving guidance without meeting the conditions). However, the range is not exactly the same as in the original answer, and the generated answer provides a broader range (7,000,000 - 10,000,000 đồng) instead of the specific range provided in the original answer (3,000,000 - 7,000,000 đồng)."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides additional information about the punishment for the offense, specifically mentioning the possibility of being punished more severely than usual. However, it does not directly answer the question about the fine amount, which is the main point of the original answer. Also, the generated answer includes some irrelevant information about the form of punishment, such as being dismissed or resigning, which is not present in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially repeats the original answer's format, mentioning a fine range, but provides a different value range (7,000,000 - 10,000,000 đồng) compared to the original answer's range (3,000,000 - 7,000,000 đồng). The original answer and generated answer share a similar question topic, but the details differ, making the relevance and similarity only partly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer. It correctly mentions that there is a regulation regarding the fine for a Notary who takes guidance when not meeting the prescribed conditions. However, the fine amount mentioned in the generated answer (7,000,000 - 10,000,000 VND) is different from the one mentioned in the original answer (3,000,000 - 7,000,000 VND)."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a similar ballpark figure for the fine as the original answer, mentioning fines up to 7,000,000 to 10,000,000 dong. However, it does not exactly match the original answer's range of 3,000,000 to 7,000,000 dong. Although the generated answer is partially relevant, it lacks the precision and accuracy of the original answer, resulting in a PARTLY_RELEVANT evaluation."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer, as both mention a fine range for a specific traffic violation. However, the generated answer provides a different fine range (16.000.000 - 18.000.000 đồng) compared to the original answer (10.000.000 - 12.000.000 đồng), which makes the generated answer non-identical to the original."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the possibility of being fined when driving recklessly, which is partially relevant to the original answer. However, it does not provide the specific fine range mentioned in the original answer (10,000,000 - 12,000,000 VND). The generated answer introduces additional information about the potential loss of driving license, which is not present in the original answer."
