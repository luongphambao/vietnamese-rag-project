RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly quotes and summarizes the original text, which is a specific regulation in a decree (Nghị định số 141/2020/NĐ-CP). The answer accurately states the regulation's requirements regarding the gap between separate sales and releases. Although the original answer is a list of conditions, the generated answer focuses on one specific condition mentioned in the original text. This indicates high relevance and accuracy between the original and generated answers."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially rephrases and reorganizes the original text, but still contains some errors in its summary. The generated answer provides specific points mentioned in the original text, but missing some crucial information such as the 06-month waiting period between separate offerings. Additionally, the generated answer rewords the original text, but loses some context and precision."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the same topic as the original answer, providing the maximum fine of 2,000,000 dong for a Chief of Police at the commune level in the field of road traffic. The answer is a straightforward response to the generated question and aligns with the content and context of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it correctly states the maximum fine for Trưởng Công an cấp xã, which is 2.000.000 đồng. However, the question and answer context are not entirely matched, as the original answer is a statement about the maximum fine, whereas the generated question is asking about the maximum fine for a specific scenario."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer does not match the exact wording of the original answer, it provides the same information and refers to the same regulation (nghị định 100/2019/NĐ-CP). The generated answer is relevant because it provides a similar but not identical answer to the original answer, which is a valid consideration for a Trưởng Công an sendo given a fine."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by providing a counterexample to the idea that there is a specific rank in the police that can be fined up to 2,000,000 VND for violating traffic safety. However, it does not directly answer the question, but instead provides additional context and information about the different levels of fines for traffic violations."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a rewritten version of the original answer, providing the same information in a slightly different format. While the content is similar, the context and phrasing of the generated answer are identical to the original answer, making it highly relevant."

The original answer is a specific monetary penalty (800,000 - 1,000,000 VND) for not slowing down and yielding the right-of-way, whereas the generated answer is a statement about the lack of a specific penalty being listed in a document (câu hỏi không có trong danh sách các hành vi vi phạm và mức phạt được ghi trong các văn bản liên quan).
