Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is about a specific event (Hurricane Harvey) that occurred in the past, and how it affected the oil refining industry. The original answer, on the other hand, focused on the impact of economic factors (interest rate decision by the US Federal Reserve, production cuts in Libya and Nigeria) on oil prices. The generated answer does not relate to these factors and is not relevant to the question asked."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer in terms of content, with a 100% match in the key information being provided, including the 'less bezel' design and 12MP camera. The structure and wording are also similar, with the same sentence structure and use of similar phrases. The only difference is the minor reformulation of the sentence, but this does not affect the relevance of the content."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, sharing the same content and wording. This indicates a high level of relevance and similarity between the two."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct response to the generated question and provides the same information as the original answer. The only difference is that it's a shorter and more concise version of the original answer, which still conveys the same meaning and relevance to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, indicating a high degree of relevance. The only difference is the context is shifted from a statement to an answer to a question, but the content itself remains the same."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original text. The original text talks about the economic and financial cooperation between Italy and Qatar, while the generated answer simply states that there is no information about Al-Emadi's trip to Europe, which is not directly relevant to the original text."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is completely unrelated to the original answer. The original answer is about a visit by Al-Emadi to several European countries, while the generated answer is about a visit by Donald Trump to Belgium and a NATO headquarters, which is not mentioned in the original text."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer does not provide a direct answer to the question, it seems to be related to the context. The original answer mentions the itinerary of Al-Emadi's trip, including stops in Europe (Italy, France, Germany, the UK, and US). The generated answer's negative response about not containing information about which countries will host Al-Emadi after his European stopover is connected to this context. However, it does not provide the requested information, which makes it PARTLY_RELEVANT rather than RELEVANT."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer, which mentions a photography exhibition 'Mẹ tôi' being held at Bảo tàng Silversmithing in Ioannina, Greece. The generated answer claims that the context does not contain the answer to a question, but the question is not even related to the original answer. Additionally, the generated answer does not contain any information about the location of Bảo tàng Silversmithing, which is the main topic of the question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is 'Không có thông tin trong văn bản cho biết nơi tổ chức triển lãm 'Mẹ tôi'', which means it does not provide any specific information about the location of the exhibition, whereas the original answer clearly states that the exhibition was held at the Bảo tàng Silversmithing in Ioannina, Greece. The generated answer does not match the original answer in terms of relevance or similarity, hence it is classified as NON_RELEVANT."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'This is Bow Wharf in London' is completely unrelated to the original context, which is about a photography exhibition 'Mẹ tôi' held at a ancient castle in Ioannina, Greece. The answer does not provide any information relevant to the original question or topic."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by stating that there is no information about the location of 'Mẹ tôi' in the given context. However, it does not provide an answer to the question about whether the location is a tower, which is the original intention of the question."
