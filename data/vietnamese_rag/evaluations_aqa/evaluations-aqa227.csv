Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer as it mentions the praise and recognition of the Iraqi fans towards the Vietnamese team's spirit, which is also mentioned in the original text. However, the generated answer is more focused on the specific quote from the Iraqi fans, whereas the original text provides a broader overview of the fans' reactions and predictions. Therefore, the generated answer captures some relevant information but not all of the original context and detail."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relevant to the original answer. Although it provides the correct information about the species Noctiluca scintilans and its bioluminescent properties, the generated answer lacks the original sentence structure and wording. The opening sentence of the generated answer is a duplicate of the original question, which makes it appear less relevant compared to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer largely overlaps with the original answer in terms of content and context. Both answers mention the same species, Noctiluca scintilans, as the cause of the phenomenon, and provide additional information about the species' bioluminescent properties and the exclusion of environmental pollution as the cause. The only difference is that the generated answer is a direct response to the generated question, whereas the original answer is part of a broader text. Nevertheless, the similarity in content and context makes the generated answer RELEVANT."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is completely irrelevant to the original answer. It tackles a different aspect of the topic (the absence of scientific names for a specific group of questions and answers) instead of providing the scientific name of the organism causing bioluminescence, which is the main point of the original answer. The generated answer does not address the content or context of the original answer at all."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question asked, as it confirms that Damsan company has a profit (lợi nhuận) in the third quarter of 2017. However, the format of the generated answer is different from the original answer, and it seems to respond to a hypothetical scenario ('sai' means 'wrong') rather than providing a direct answer to the question. A more relevant response might have answered the question directly, e.g. 'Không, Công ty cổ phần Damsan có lợi nhuận sau thuế trong quý III/2017 là 21,4 tỷ đồng'."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer exactly, including the same numbers and format."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions 'doanh thu' (revenue) which is a different financial metric than 'lợi nhuận sau thuế' (net profit after tax) mentioned in the original answer. The numbers and context also do not match, making it non-relevant to the original question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer word-for-word, indicating a high degree of relevance and similarity. The context and content of the generated answer accurately reproduce the original answer, making it a suitable and relevant response."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately mentions the same missing components related to environmental protection as the original answer, including hồ điều hòa, bể chỉ thị sinh học, hệ thống quan trắc tự động nước thải sau xử lý, hệ thống quan trắc tự động khí thải, camera giám sát. Additionally, it also mentions the other important information present in the original answer, such as the lack of submitting environmental reports and the incomplete firefighting system. The generated answer is mostly relevant to the original answer, with some minor deviations in wording and organization."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, where it lists the same missing components related to environmental protection. The only difference is that the generated answer does not mention the report of environmental monitoring. However, this is a minor omission, and the overall content of the generated answer is consistent with the original answer, making it relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it accurately summarizes the missing systems of the Nghi Sơn refinery, specifically the ones related to monitoring and control (water and air emissions, cameras, etc.). The generated answer does not add new information but rather restates the information from the original answer."
