Although the generated answer is concise and targeted, it does not fully capture the essence or context of the original answer, which describes the entire process and associated procedures."

However, the content and information provided in the generated answer match the original answer closely."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information about the cases where a driver's license can be revoked for violating traffic regulations, including specific points from the original text.

Additionally, the generated answer does not provide any information on fines for violating traffic regulations."

Additionally, the generated answer does not provide a direct quote from the law, which further diminishes its relevance."

However, the generated answer does not accurately provide the fine range mentioned in the original answer, which is 500,000-1,000,000 VND, instead providing a range of 1,000,000-2,000,000 VND. This indicates a partial relevance but not entirely accurate response."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it discusses the penalty for lacking mandatory content in a chemical safety record. However, the specific range of penalties (1.000.000 – 2.000.000 đồng) differs from the original answer (500.000 – 1.000.000 đồng). The generated answer also provides a slightly wider range, which reduces its relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is almost identical to the original answer, with only a small change in wording. The information provided in the generated answer accurately corresponds to the same information in the original answer, which mentions the fine range of 500.000 đồng to 1.000.000 đồng for violators who fail to include required contents in safety reports."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer addresses the topic of punishment for violating the mandatory contents of the Chemical Safety Declaration form, it provides a different range of fines compared to the original answer.
