Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original information. The generated answer correctly identifies the specific range of fines for organizations ($6,000,000 to $10,000,000) and mentions the specific behavior (making false statements on traffic signs). However, it fails to mention the range of fines for individuals ($3,000,000 to $5,000,000), which is an important detail present in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately quotes the minimum fine for individual violators of traffic signs and signals, which is 3.000.000 đồng, directly corresponding to the original answer. The two answers have the same content and value, indicating strong relevance and similarity."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer in terms of content and context. The main idea of both answers is that there is a difference in the fine range between individuals and organizations that violate traffic signs and signals. The generated answer also provides more detail than the original answer by specifying the fine ranges for individuals and organizations, making it a more complete and relevant answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a paraphrased version of the original answer, providing the same information in a slightly rephrased manner. The original answer mentions the need for companies to register changes in charter capital and member contributions, while the generated answer focuses on the timeframe for registering changes in charter capital when a member has not yet fully contributed. The language used is similar, and the answer still conveys the same essential information as the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer by providing the time frame for changing the charter capital. However, it lacks the specific requirement of registering the change with the authorities within the given timeframe."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, it's almost a direct copy. It includes the same information and even the same wording, it's not a rewritten version, but a copy of the original. The only difference is the presence of the question in the beginning, but the rest of the content is identical."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question, as it provides the correct timeframe (30 days) for changing the charter capital when a member fails to contribute the required capital. However, it does not fully answer the question, as it does not specify the condition under which the charter capital needs to be changed. Instead, it provides the same condition mentioned in the original answer: 'kể từ ngày cuối cùng phải góp đủ phần vốn góp theo quy định'. Therefore, the answer is partly relevant to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is directly related to the original answer, providing the same regulation and time frame (30 days) for changing the capital contributions of a limited liability company (company TNHH) in case a member has not yet contributed enough capital."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not relate to the original answer, which specifically mentions a fine range of 300,000 to 400,000 VND. The generated answer discusses a 'phụ thu' (supplement) related to vehicle maintenance, but is not relevant to the original answer's context, which appears to be a law or regulation related to education."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer, as it also mentions the same fine range of 300,000 to 400,000 VND. However, the context in which it is presented is different and does not directly address the original fine range, which is related to an unspecified traffic offense. The generated answer appears to be a reworded version of the original answer, addressing a question about the fine range for opening a car door while driving."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is completely unrelated to the original answer, which is a specific fine range for a particular scenario. The generated answer is actually a reformulation of the question, and it does not provide any relevant information related to the fine range."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer states a different fine range (100,000 - 200,000 VND) compared to the original answer (300,000 - 400,000 VND). Although both answers mention fines related to car violations, the generated answer provides incorrect information, making it non-relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions a fine range, which is a partial match with the original answer. However, the specific fine range provided (60,000-100,000) is significantly different from the original answer (300,000-400,000). The original answer discusses a fine range for a specific scenario ( velocidad), while the generated answer lacks this context and seems to provide a general fine range."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer in terms of content and structure. Both answers mention the same fine range of 2.000.000 đồng to 4.000.000 đồng, which is a direct response to the question. Although the generated answer is not an exact copy of the original answer, it conveys the same information and is a correct answer to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is directly referencing the same specific penalty range (2.000.000 to 4.000.000 đồng) as the original answer. The generated question is asking for the same information, and the answer provides an exact match to the original answer."
