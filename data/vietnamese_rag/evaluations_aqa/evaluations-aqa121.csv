Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, conveying the same information and using the same sentence structure. There is no significant difference in content, tone, or context between the two, indicating high relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly restates the original answer, reiterating that the people of Russia will decide the next president through a democratic election, without adding or changing any information. The tone and language are also similar, indicating that the generated answer is relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of mentioning a democratic election as the means to decide the successor. However, it does not mention the specific context of Putin's presidency coming to an end and the post-election scenario on what the people will decide, which is mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially reiterates the original answer by mentioning the concept of a democratic election, but it lacks specific details about the process, such as the fact that people will decide the next President after Putin's term ends. The generated answer is also missing the nuance about the people deciding the next president through a democratic election."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant as it extracts the main application of UAVs in agriculture, which is mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer accurately includes the specific tasks such as phun thuốc trừ sâu cho lúa mì, phun thuốc cỏ dại, tưới nước and bón phân, which are also present in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the correct information about the province where the UAV is used for pesticide spraying (Giang Tô), and also mentions the same type of crop (lúa mì, rice) as the original answer. However, it adds an unnecessary location (Trung Quốc, China) and does not provide the same level of detail as the original answer, such as the statistics of the drone's phun ability."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partly matches with the original answer in terms of mentioning the advantage of UAV in terms of higher productivity (from 40-60 times) compared to traditional methods. However, it lacks the additional information provided in the original answer, such as the type of crops, range of application, and other activities that UAVs can perform. The generated answer only focuses on one aspect of the original answer, which reduces its overall relevance and similarity to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer mentions DJI Agras MG-1, which is the same as the original answer, the context of the answer is slightly different. The original answer provides specific information about the usage of the drone, such as spraying fertilizer and pesticides, whereas the generated answer only provides the name of the drone. This reduces the relevance of the answer to the original question, making it PARTLY_RELEVANT rather than RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer acknowledges that there is no information provided in the context about the area UAV can cover in 10 minutes. While it doesn't directly provide the answer, it still references the original context and question.

RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly relevant to the original answer, as it mentions the same criteria for the VFF's requirements for the coach candidate, including having a professional coaching license, experience as a coach for professional clubs or national teams, proficiency in English, and no record of disciplinary action.

Only minor differences in wording and sentence structure are present, which do not affect the overall relevance of the answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not address the question, nor does it relate to the original answer's content.

The two topics are disconnected, and there is no similarity between the generated answer and the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it acknowledges the absence of information about the salary of the coach, which is one of the criteria in the original text. However, the answer does not address the original question about the criteria for selecting the coach or provide any relevant information, making it only partly relevant to the original text."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, with almost identical content and phrases.
