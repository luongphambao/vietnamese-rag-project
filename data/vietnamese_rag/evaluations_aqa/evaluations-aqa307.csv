Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, and the content is almost identical. The only minor difference is that the generated answer uses the phrase 'để biến thành phân bón' (to become compost) which is not present in the original answer, but it still conveys the same meaning. The context and clarity of the generated answer is consistent with the original answer, and it adequately answers the question."

Although it does not exactly replicate the original answer, the generated answer is closely related and provides complementary information, making it relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly a repetitive copying of the original answer, which provides the same information. While it partially answers the question, it does not provide any additional insights or explanation, and the rephrasing is minimal. The relevance score is PARTLY_RELEVANT because the generated answer still conveys the necessary information, but it lacks creativity and substantial changes."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it accurately summarizes the consequence of birds getting caught in the sticky fruits of the Pisonia tree, which is mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer also includes additional details about the sticky fruits, which reinforces its relevance to the original text."
