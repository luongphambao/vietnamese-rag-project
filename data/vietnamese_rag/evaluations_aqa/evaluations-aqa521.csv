However, the generated answer does not provide the exact punishment range (1.000.000 – 5.000.000 đồng) mentioned in the original answer. Instead, it provides a different punishment range (80.000.000 – 100.000.000 đồng) and also explains the basis for the punishment, which is not present in the original answer. Overall, the generated answer partially relates to the original answer but provides different information and context."
