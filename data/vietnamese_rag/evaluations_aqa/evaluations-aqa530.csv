RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the exact same information as the original answer, with the same range of fines (1.000.000 đồng to 2.000.000 đồng) for passengers who surrender their seats to other passengers without their consent.

The original answer mentions a fine for an unspecified type of vehicle, whereas the generated answer focuses on a specific type of vehicle allowed to transfer passengers. The answer lacks the crucial information about the fine, making it partially relevant, but not fully relevant, to the original answer."
