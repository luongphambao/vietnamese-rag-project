Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is irrelevant to the original answer because it states that there is no information about Đức Huy's injury, but the original answer provides specific information about Đức Huy's injury being a 'lật cổ chân' (ankle sprain). The generated answer does not address the question about Đức Huy's injury, which is exactly what the question is asking."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not mention Tuấn Anh, Pablo, or any physical therapy treatment, which are crucial elements in the original answer. The answer appears to be about hospital registration and transfer of patients, which is unrelated to the original context."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not provide any relevant information about Tuấn Anh's injury. Instead, it claims that there is no information about his injury, which is not in line with the original answer that describes Tuấn Anh's specific injury (giàn cơ) and treatment (physical therapy with Pablo)."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is correct in stating that there is no information about Đức Huy's injury location in the provided text, it is not directly addressing the question asked. The question is asking about Đức Huy's injury spot, whereas the generated answer is simply stating the lack of information. The generated answer is partially relevant because it is providing a correct, but indirect, response to the question, and it requires the user to piece together the information from the original answer to get the desired answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, with the same structure and content. It accurately conveys HLV Claudio Ubeda's high evaluation of U.20 Vietnam's team strength and the upcoming friendly match. The only difference is that the generated answer is slightly more repetitive, but the core meaning and context remain identical to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides similar content to the original answer, including the same quotation from HLV Claudio Ubeda about the upcoming friendly match being a good preparation for U.20 Argentina's World Cup campaign. The generated answer also adds additional information about adapting to Asian weather, but this does not detract from the overall relevance to the original answer. The generated answer accurately conveys the main point of the original answer, making it considered 'RELEVANT'."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer, as it paraphrases the same information and conveys the same idea. The only difference is in wording, with the original answer using more complex sentences and the generated answer breaking it down into simpler phrases. The context and content of the generated answer match the original answer well, accurately summarizing the main point about the importance of the friendly match for U.20 Argentina's World Cup preparation."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relevant to the original answer as it mentions U.20 Argentina, World Cup, and Vietnam, which are common elements in both answers. However, the generated answer also includes additional unnecessary information about U.20 Argentina's goals, specific teams they will play, and a specific past tournament (U20 World Cup 2017), which is not present in the original answer. The relevance is partly because the core information about U.20 Argentina and World Cup is present, but the additional details make the answer less relevant overall."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains the correct information about the friendly match between U.20 Argentina and U.20 Vietnam, but the relevance is partly relevant because it only focuses on the timing of the match (before the U20 World Cup 2017) whereas the original answer mentions the player's assessment of the team's potential and the match as preparation for the tournament, which is not mentioned in the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, covering the same key points: Triều Tiên's demands for Korea and the US to stop hostile policies and return 12 personnel who fled from a North Korean restaurant in China. While the wording and sentence structure differ slightly, the main content is identical to the original answer, making it highly relevant."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is not an exact copy of the original answer, it still maintains the core idea and key points. The generated answer conveys the condition imposed by North Korea (Triều Tiên) for diplomatic talks with South Korea and the US, which is consistent with the original answer. The additional details about the 12 employees fleeing from a North Korean restaurant in China are not crucial to the relevance of the answer. The generated answer demonstrates understanding of the context and major points, making it RELEVANT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it provides specific information about the 12 employees who were required to be returned, which is the main point of the original answer. However, it lacks some context and details, as it doesn't mention the reason behind the request, the notion of 'trapping' or 'refuge' and doesn't cover the dispute between North Korea and South Korea."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a verbatim copy of the original answer, including the same sentence structure and almost identical wording. This suggests that the generated answer closely matches the original answer in terms of content and context, indicating high relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately conveys the correct information about the perspective of Hàn Quốc, which is that the 12 servants had sought asylum in Hàn Quốc. However, it does not capture the full context of the original answer, which includes the fact that the servants fled from a North Korean restaurant in China and the conflicting claims by the two sides regarding their circumstances. The generated answer is not entirely relevant because it lacks the nuances and complexity of the original answer."
