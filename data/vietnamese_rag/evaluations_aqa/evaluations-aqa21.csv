While the original answer emphasizes the hope that FBI colleagues will 'keep the Constitution' and 'the values and mission of protecting American people', the generated answer asks for the FBI colleagues' efforts in 'maintaining the Constitution' and 'living with the values and mission of protecting American people'. Although the main idea is preserved, the generated answer lacks the original's sense of urgency and emphasis on keeping the Constitution."
