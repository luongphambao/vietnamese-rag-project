Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions Lê Văn Thọ, a different person, and says he was caught in Hải Dương, which is unrelated to the original answer describing an attack by a bear on Mr. Promratee. The names, locations, and events in the generated answer do not match with the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer. The original answer describes an incident where Mr. Promratee was attacked by a bear, while the generated answer talks about a completely different person named 'Cháu Nghĩa' being murdered. The context, characters, and events are unrelated, indicating a high level of irrelevance between the two answers."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by stating that 'Dữ liệu không cung cấp thông tin về việc ai nỗ lực cứu Mr. Promratee' meaning that the data does not provide information about who attempted to save Mr. Promratee. While it does not provide the actual efforts made, it does acknowledge the lack of information, which is related to the original answer's mention of people trying to save Mr. Promratee. However, the answer does not provide any specific or meaningful information about the rescue efforts, making it only partly relevant."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer, as it talks about the suspects being questioned and identifying one of them as the perpetrator, whereas the original answer describes an incident where a tourist was attacked by a bear and was lucky to survive. The two answers do not share any common information or context, making the generated answer irrelevant to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the correct and relevant information about the real name of the Korean hot girl similar to Tú Linh, which is Son Jiyoung. It accurately answers the generated question and is similar in content and context to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the nickname of Son Jiyoung, which is indeed part of the original answer. However, the content of the generated answer is not entirely accurate, as the original answer mentions the nickname is @uare_mine, not Delicious Proposal. The relevance score is PARTLY_RELEVANT because the generated answer is partially correct in terms of the topic, but the specific detail is incorrect."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'CONTEXT không có thông tin về Son Jiyoung.' does not contain any relevant information about Son Jiyoung's country of origin, which is the topic of the original question. The answer is simply stating that there is no information about Son Jiyoung, but does not provide any answer to the original question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is stating that the interviewer cannot find any information about Son Jiyoung's age, but the original answer was providing information about Son Jiyoung's age (24 years old) and some additional details. The generated answer is not related to the original answer and does not provide any relevant information."

Although the question and answer formats differ, the content of the generated answer is directly related to the original answer, providing more detail about Son Jiyoung's nationality."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it provides the same information about the number of cases of fake documentation discovered (hàng nghìn trường hợp), although it is slightly condensed. The original answer provides more details about the consequences of fake documentation (trục lợi hàng nghìn tỷ đồng), but the generated answer still conveys the main idea of the original answer."

RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it provides similar information about the methods used to fake documents of people with contributions.

These methods are identical to those mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer is slightly more concise and organized than the original answer, which provides more specific details about the cases of fake documents and the challenges of recovering stolen funds."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it specifically mentions the methods of falsifying profiles of people who rendered service to the country, which aligns with the original answer.

RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the correct answer in the original text, with almost identical wording.
