Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer by providing a range of fine amounts (10.000.000 đồng đến 20.000.000 đồng) which is similar to the range in the original answer (10.000.000 đồng đến 15.000.000 đồng). However, the generated answer mentions a higher upper limit (20.000.000 đồng) than the original answer, which reduces its relevance. Overall, the generated answer is somewhat relevant but not entirely accurate."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information about the fine range for violating rules, but it's not directly related to the original answer. The original answer provides a price range for a specific amount, while the generated answer talks about the fines for violating dance club operation rules. Although they use the same price range, the context and topic are different, making the generated answer partly relevant to the original answer."

Although the wording is similar, the generated answer does not simply reproduce the original answer but instead elaborates on the point about ensuring information security and provides evidence to support this claim."

The generated answer specifically highlights the importance of compatibility, integrability, and data sharing with other relevant databases, which is a key aspect of the original answer. The generated answer also mentions the necessity of expansion, upgrading, and development of the database, which is also mentioned in the original answer."

The generated answer accurately answers the generated question, demonstrating a high level of relevance and similarity to the original answer."
