Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains the same information as the original answer, specifically the recipient of the congratulatory telegram and the occasion, which is the 80th birthday of the person. The format and wording are also similar. The only difference is the absence of the additional information about the telegram sent to the Prince of Liechtenstein, but this does not affect the relevance of the answer to the original context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially answers the generated question 'Bounnhang Vorachith là ai?' by providing his position ('Chủ tịch nước Cộng hòa Dân chủ Nhân dân Lào'), but does not answer the full question, which is looking for his identity ('who is'). The original answer contains similar information, but also provides additional information that is not present in the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer includes some relevant information, specifically the date of birth (15-8-1937), which is mentioned in the original answer. However, the context is different, as the original answer is a congratulatory message on Bounnhang Vorachith's 80th birthday, while the generated question is about his birthday date. The relevance is partly due to the inclusion of the correct date, but not entirely accurate in terms of context and purpose."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant in the sense that it mentions the same events (greeting messages) as the original answer. However, it deviates from the original answer by including unnecessary information, specifically the second occasion (National Day of Liechtenstein), which is not a direct answer to the generated question. The part about the celebration of President Tran Dai Quang's 80th birthday is correctly copied from the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer, as it correctly provides the date of Liechtenstein's national day (August 15th). However, the generated answer does not capture the context of the original answer, which is a statement from the President of Vietnam sending congratulatory messages on the occasion of various national days."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is simply rephrasing the original question and does not provide any new information or related ideas. It does not demonstrate an understanding of the context and fails to provide a meaningful response to the question, making it non-relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately answers the generated question, providing the correct reason for Justin Gatlin's ban from competition (sử dụng doping). Although the context of the generated answer is related to a specific event, it is still highly relevant to the original answer, which discusses IAAF's anti-doping efforts and the surprise loss of Usain Bolt to Justin Gatlin."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not mention Usain Bolt, Justin Gatlin, or any context related to their rivalry, which is the main topic of the original answer. The answer also mentions a different person, Dian Kristanto, who is not mentioned in the original text, and the context of the original text does not relate to Indonesia or the IAAF honoring anyone from Indonesia."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the specific event (gọn vạu định kinh thế giới 2017) where Justin Gatlin and Usain Bolt met, which is directly related to the context of the original answer. The original answer mentions Usain Bolt being defeated by Justin Gatlin, and the generated answer supports this information by providing the specific event where this occurred."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct translation of the original answer, preserving the temperature range information (30-33oC). Although the question and format are slightly different, the answer is still conveying the same information as the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, conveying the same information and using the same wording. The only minor difference is the source language (the generated answer is in Vietnamese, while the original answer is in Vietnamese as well). The answer accurately answers the generated question and provides the desired temperature range for the specified date."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, with the same information about the temperature range in the Nam Bộ region. The only difference is the use of dates in a different format, which does not affect the content or accuracy of the answer. The answer accurately conveys the same information as the original answer, making it relevant."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer '星期星期五' is completely unrelated to the original answer 'Nhiệt độ cao nhất tại Nam Bộ trong ngày 17/5 sẽ ở mức từ 30 - 33oC', which provides information about the highest temperature in the South of Vietnam on May 17th. The generated answer is a response to a question about the day of the week ( 星期几是5月17日？) but lacks any connection to the original context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the exact same information about the highest temperature in the South region on 17/5. The answer matches both in terms of language (Vietnamese) and content, making it highly relevant."
