Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the same information about the price of the new Renault Duster model, making it highly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains some relevant information, such as the price of the car being mentioned (363 triệu đồng), which matches the price specified in the original answer. However, the answer is not entirely relevant as it strays from the question and provides additional details about the car's features, which are not necessary for answering the question about the price. Overall, the generated answer partially addresses the question but could be more focused and concise."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer consists of the same text as the original answer, which indicates a high level of similarity and relevance. However, the generated answer lacks context and does not provide any new information. The relevance is partly relevant because the identical text shares the same content as the original answer, but fails to provide any added value or insight."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the main idea of the original answer, which is that transferring the obligation (nghĩa vụ) can avoid risk better than authorizing a third party. However, the generated answer lacks specific details and examples provided in the original answer, making it less relevant to the original content."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially consists of relevant information, specifically mentioning the person who executes the obligation. However, it also includes additional context and phrases from the original answer that are not directly answering the question. The answer could be improved by focusing on the main point and avoiding unnecessary elaboration."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer touches on the topic of transferring civil obligations, but deviates from the original answer in terms of the scope and specific details. While the original answer provides a general overview of the process and its benefits, the generated answer focuses more on the definition of civil obligations and the role of individuals and households in this process. The generated answer also introduces new legislation (Law on Enterprises 2014) and concepts (households using land) that are not present in the original answer. Despite these differences, the generated answer does attempt to address the general topic of transferring civil obligations, which earns it a PARTLY_RELEVANT evaluation."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content. It mentions the existence of risks in the process of transferring obligations, as well as the fact that these risks are limited and rare in practice, except for a few special cases. However, the generated answer is not a verbatim copy of the original answer and lacks some of the specific details, such as the requirement for the obligation transferor to receive payment or fulfill their obligations before requesting reimbursement. Additionally, the generated answer does not provide a clear flow or organization of ideas like the original answer does."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer 'Benfica' as it provides specific information about Benfica's consecutive championships in the Portuguese football league. The answer is a direct response to the generated question and conveys accurate information, making it a relevant output."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is directly analogous to the original answer 'Benfica', which is the correct answer to the question. The generated answer provides the same piece of information and has the same level of specificity, making it highly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, both being the name of the team that won the Portuguese league 4 years in a row, which is Benfica. The generated answer provides additional context about the team's achievement, but the main information is accurate and matches the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly quotes the original answer, Benfica, as the team that has won the championship most recently. The generated answer provides the same information as the original answer, verbatim."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, 'Benfica', and provides the same information. The generated question and answer are in Vietnamese, indicating a high level of context similarity. The relevance is 'RELEVANT' because the generated answer accurately and completely answers the question from the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions the same topic (Noo Phước Thịnh and the Mr-Meuw fashion collection) as the original answer. However, the generated answer is incomplete, as it only replicates the question instead of providing the correct answer (Noo Phước Thịnh being the male model who showcased the collection). Therefore, while it captures some relevant information, the overall relevance is limited."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it states the same information as the original answer, i.e., Noo Phước Thịnh is the male model who performed catwalks 'chất đến ngất' at Chung Thanh Phong's show. However, the generated answer repeats the original question and does not provide any additional context or information, which is unusual for a generated answer. A more ideal response would be a straightforward answer without repeating the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer. It provides the same information about Noo Phước Thịnh's role in the Mr-Meuw collection, including being a male model and performing catwalks that impressed the audience. The language used is also very close to the original, with only minor variations in wording. As a result, the generated answer is highly relevant and similar to the original answer."
