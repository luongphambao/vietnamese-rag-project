Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer appears to be a question itself, unrelated to the original answer, which is a specific fine range (Phạt tiền từ 1.000.000 đồng đến 2.000.000 đồng). The generated answer does not provide any relevant information or context matching the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is about the minimum fine for a specific violation, while the original answer is about the fine range for a different context. The numbers mentioned in the generated answer (20,000,000) are also significantly different from the range mentioned in the original answer (1,000,000 to 2,000,000). There is no context or keywords shared between the two, making the generated answer non-relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer's context by discussing the punishment for not reporting the monitoring results. However, it only focuses on the group '1' of Laws and doesn't provide a specific punishment range like the original answer does, which is a critical aspect of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer. While the prompt asks for the difference between 'vật liệu' and 'sản phẩm', the generated answer provides a detailed description of 'vật liệu' and concludes by linking it to the resulting 'sản phẩm' through a process of transformation and application of scientific and technological outcomes. Although the prompt explicitly asked for the difference, the generated answer addresses the core concept by describing the relationship between input 'vật liệu' and output 'sản phẩm'."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially resembles the original answer as it correctly identifies 'người lao động' (workers) as the ones who act and change the materials in the environment sector. However, the generated answer regurgitates the original question verbatim, without providing any substantial new information or a different perspective, making it relevant but not entirely useful."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the main idea and key points from the original answer, but with some minor inaccuracies and missing details. Specifically, the generated answer is missing the mention of 'đầu vào' (input) in the original answer, which is a crucial part of the concept. Additionally, the generated answer rephrases the sentence in a slightly different way, but still conveys the main purpose of transforming materials in the environmental resources industry."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the condition for transferring an office of the executor, which is required to have operated for at least 2 years from the date of operation registration. This is partially relevant to the original answer, as it correctly identifies one of the conditions for transferring an office of the executor. However, the generated answer does not mention other conditions, such as no establishment, participation, or re-establishment of a new office within 5 years, after transferring the office, which are also part of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it correctly captures the minimum operation period required for a notary office to be transferred, which is 2 years. However, it lacks the additional condition specified in the original answer about the notary office being active from the date of registration. Additionally, the generated answer does not mention the prohibited involvement in setting up a new notary office within 5 years from the transfer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer aligns with the original answer, providing a direct quote and summarizing the same information. Although it lacks additional context, the answer accurately answers the question and provides a clear response."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct extraction of a specific detail from the original answer. The content is accurate and similar in context to the original answer. The generated answer contains the same timeframe (5 năm) and criteria ( kể từ ngày chuyển nhượng) mentioned in the original answer. The only difference is that the generated answer is a direct answer to a specific question, whereas the original answer is part of a broader text. Hence, the relevance is classified as RELEVANT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is closely related to the original question, providing specific information about the restrictions and possibilities for notaries who have transferred their notary office. The generated answer accurately restates the information from the original answer, specifically referencing the 5-year restriction on establishing a new notary office and the permission to practice as a notary on a contract basis. The generated answer is mostly a paraphrased repetition of the original answer, but with some slight rephrasing of the wording, which does not significantly alter the meaning or intent of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer (Mức phạt đối với hành vi cưỡi trâu/ngựa/chạy đua trái phép trên đường là từ 1.000.000 đồng đến 2.000.000 đồng) is partially relevant to the original answer (Phạt tiền từ 1.000.000 đồng đến 2.000.000 đồng). Both answers mention a fine range, but the generated answer is more specific and provides additional information about the context (riding buffalo/ horses and running amok on the road). Although the tone and structure are slightly different, the overall content is similar, making it partly relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct quote of the original answer. Both the original and generated answers are identical in terms of content and context. The generated answer accurately answers the provided question, and there is a high degree of similarity between the two."
