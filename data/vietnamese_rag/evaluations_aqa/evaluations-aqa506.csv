The original answer refers to Article 11 of Decree 24/2016/NĐ-CP, while the generated answer mentions Article 4 of Decree 96/2004/NĐ-CP. Although the sources and specific conditions differ, the general topic and direction are similar."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not address the question about the specific time point that regulates the issue of who does not receive interest. Instead, it asks for additional information, which is an unrelated response to the original question. The generated answer lacks information about the regulatory decree mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original context, as it mentions the time period for which the interest is not paid. However, the original answer specifically mentions the relevant decree and article, whereas the generated answer does not provide that information. Additionally, the phrase 'only principal amount will be returned' is not present in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it discusses the responsibilities of Bộ Tài nguyên và Môi trường, which is the same entity mentioned in the original answer.

The original answer is a ministry, whereas the generated answer mentions a specific office."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer. The original answer is related to the restrictions and regulations for import/export of goods in Vietnam, while the generated answer provides some additional information about the types of goods that require a license to trade. The generated answer includes some relevant information, such as 'hàng hóa bị hạn chế xuất khẩu' (goods subject to export restriction), which is similar to the original answer. However, the generated answer also introduces new and irrelevant information, such as 'hàng hóa có cầu với nước ngoài' (goods with demand from abroad) and 'hàng hóa có chứa các nguyên liệu hoặc bao gồm các sản phẩm có thể gây tổn hại đến an toàn hoạt động kinh doanh' (goods containing materials that may harm business operations), which are not mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relevant to the original answer. It correctly mentions that there are specific types of goods that require a permit to engage in business transfer, such as goods requiring specialized inspection, goods requiring safety inspection, and goods requiring inspection for their ability to withstand storage and transportation. However, it does not directly address the original answer's requirement for permits for certain specific types of goods mentioned in article a) of the original text, such as goods cấm xuất khẩu, cấm nhập khẩu, tạm ngừng xuất khẩu, tạm ngừng nhập khẩu, etc. The answer only provides a general framework for obtaining permits, which is not directly related to the specific requirements mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the correct entity 'Sở Kế hoạch và Đầu tư tỉnh, thành phố trực thuộc trung ương' but the context is incorrect.

However, it does not mention the original answer's additional case, where the business is moving goods directly from the export country to the import country without going through Vietnamese customs, which is an important exception to the permit requirement. The answer also does not explicitly state that some goods, such as prohibited or restricted goods, do not require a permit, which is an important aspect of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of topic and context, as it also talks about the violation of regulations regarding food transportation with hazardous chemicals and the potential fines. However, the specific amount mentioned in the generated answer (50 triệu đồng) is not mentioned in the original answer, and the original answer mentions a specific range of fines (10.000.000 - 15.000.000 đồng). Furthermore, the generated answer adds additional consequences (tước quyền sử dụng giấy phép kinh doanh, đình chỉ và truy thu khoản tiền phạt) that are not mentioned in the original answer, making it only partly relevant."
