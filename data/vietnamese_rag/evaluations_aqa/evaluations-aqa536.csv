Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it addresses the same topic as the original answer (violation of regulations on standard and quota usage) and provides similar information (fine range). However, it lacks context and rephrases the original answer in a way that makes it less clear and concise. Specifically, the generated answer is missing the details about the responsibility of organizations in managing their resources, which is an important aspect of the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a duplicate of the generated question, which is not relevant to the original answer. The original answer provides specific information about the fine range and circumstances, while the generated answer is a repetitive and unanswered question."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer provides some relevant information about the violation of regulations on managing a company's assets, the context and scope are different from the original answer. The original answer specifically talks about the violation of regulations on managing public funds by a state-owned enterprise, whereas the generated answer is more general and applies to a private company. Additionally, the fine ranges mentioned in the generated answer are different from the original answer. Despite these differences, the generated answer still conveys the idea of violating regulations, which makes it partially relevant to the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not address the original answer's topic of discussing fines and punishment for violating regulations related to the management of public service facilities, and instead provides a definition for 'Cơ sở hoạt động sự nghiệp' which is a separate topic."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer captures the main point of the original answer, which is that the change of founder shareholders in a joint-stock company must be publicly announced. However, the generated answer lacks the specific detail about the timeline for the public announcement, which is an important aspect of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer as it mentions the topic of changing a founding shareholder, which is the same as the original answer's topic. However, the generated answer incorrectly states that there is no regulation on the disclosure timeline, whereas the original answer clearly specifies a 30-day deadline for public disclosure. The generated answer lacks the specific regulation mentioned in the original answer, which reduces its relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer mentions the place to declare changes to shareholders, it is not accurate. The original answer states that the company must publicly announce changes to shareholders through the National Business Registration Portal, whereas the generated answer mentions the State Treasury (Kho bạc Nhà nước), which is not the correct location. The generated answer partially addresses the question, but the information is not accurate."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by mentioning the need for the company to report changes to its shareholders to the relevant authorities. However, it does not directly provide the information requested, which is the specific method for knowing about changes to shareholders. Instead, it offers general guidance on the laws and regulations that apply to companies, which is not directly relevant to the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a different regulation requirement for publicly floating companies, unrelated to the original answer's focus on the mandatory public disclosure of changes in the founding shareholders within 30 days. The generated answer seems to be sidetracked, discussing a different aspect of company operation."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it extracts and presents the same key activities (xây dựng mô hình, nhân rộng mô hình, và quản lý dự án) mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer includes additional context (nội dung xây dựng mô hình...) similar to the original answer. While the generated answer is somewhat abridged, it still conveys the same main points as the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer largely corresponds to the original answer's content and context. The generated answer mentions the roles of provincial organizations in a central project, specifically highlighting their involvement in model construction, dissemination, and project management, which is in line with the original answer's content. The generated answer even includes similar phrases and sentences as the original answer. The only difference is that the generated answer is more concise and organized, which is due to the natural language generation process. Overall, the generated answer demonstrates high relevance to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the main points of the original answer, specifically mentioning the required targets of the central agricultural project, which corresponds to the original answer's mention of 'đáp ứng mục tiêu, phạm vi và nội dung chương trình khuyến nông đã được phê duyệt hoặc nhiệm vụ đột xuất'. Additionally, the generated answer correctly includes the requirements of technology and consent from authorized parties, which is also present in the original answer. The generated answer provides a concise and relevant summary of the original answer's content."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it discusses the role of Bộ Nông nghiệp và Phát triển nông thôn (Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) in approving the central agricultural project. Although the generated answer does not exactly match the content of the original answer, it does mention the ministry's role in approving projects, which is a key point mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the original content, specifically the mentioning of 'cấp có thẩm quyền công nhận hoặc chấp thuận' being present in both answers. However, the generated answer also includes 'theo thông tư pháp lý' which is not present in the original answer, and the tone and structure of the answer are also different. While the generated answer conveys a similar idea, it is not identical to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question about the cost of the tag installation, but it does not directly answer the question about whether the cost is free. The answer instead provides a relevant but oblique comment about the cost being dependent on the user's account balance, which is not directly related to the original answer. The original answer primarily focuses on the date-based change in policy for charging the cost of tag installation, which is not mentioned in the generated answer."
