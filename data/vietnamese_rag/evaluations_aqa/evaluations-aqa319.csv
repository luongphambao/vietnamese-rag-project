Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the context of the original answer, as it mentions a person who is important in Vietnamese football. However, it does not fully capture the key characteristics ('sắc sảo' but 'trầm mặc') or the specific achievements mentioned in the original answer, which limits its relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions HLV Nguyễn Hữu Thắng, who is a coach, while the original answer mentions a 'người đàn ông sắc sảo nhưng trầm mặc' (a sophisticated but taciturn man), which is likely a metaphor or a figurative description of a coach or a team leader. Although the topics are related, the specific term used in the original answer (a person, not a coach) is not matched in the generated answer. Nevertheless, the generated answer aims to identify a key factor in the success of young Vietnamese teams, which aligns with the general context of the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a repetition of the generated question, lacking any relevant information or context. The original answer provides a specific example and details about a situation, whereas the generated answer does not add any new information or insight."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer in terms of the content and structure. It reproduces the main points mentioned by Thầy Lê Xuân Chiến, including reducing existing issues in the education system, decreasing subject loads, eliminating the pressure of academic achievement, and preventing private tuitions. The generated answer also includes the same list of compulsory subjects in primary school and the same issues regarding the shortage of time for extracurricular activities. The only difference is that the generated answer is an exact duplicate of the original answer, which might indicate that the RAG system is simply copying the original answer rather than generating a new one that is similar but not identical."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer, as it mentions some of the required subjects in the new program, specifically mentioning the ones at the elementary level. However, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the entire program, and the context of the original answer is not fully captured, particularly regarding the problems and solutions mentioned by Thầy Lê Xuân Chiến."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly repetitive and similar to the original answer, but it does not fully address the context of the generated question.

Additionally, the generated answer does not provide any new insights or perspectives, and is largely a copy-paste of the original answer."

While it answers part of the question, it is not relevant to the original context and topic."
