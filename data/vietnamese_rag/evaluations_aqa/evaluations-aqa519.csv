Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer as it mentions the time frame for the exchange to make a decision, which is something mentioned in the original answer. However, the specific time frame '07 ngày làm việc kể từ ngày hủy bỏ niêm yết có hiệu lực' mentioned in the generated answer is not consistent with the original answer which mentions '30 ngày kể từ ngày nhận được hồ sơ'. The generated answer also drifts away from the main topic of the original answer, which is the process of registering for listing, and instead focuses on the regulations for annulment of listing."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer only mentions that if the time period of social insurance payment is less than one year, the employee does not get a one-time social insurance payment, which is not the same as the original answer, which states that the social insurance benefit is calculated based on the amount of social insurance paid, with a maximum of 02 months of average monthly salary."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question, but with some inaccuracies and lack of relevance to the original answer. The original answer mentions that when the time of social insurance contributions is less than one year, the social insurance benefit is equivalent to the amount of contributions, capped at 02 months of the average monthly salary. In contrast, the generated answer incorrectly mentions that the benefit is based on the number of years of contributions and lacks the cap mentioned in the original answer. Although it mentions that there is a case where the benefit is equal to the amount of contributions, the specific rules and conditions are not accurately presented."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses the conditions and calculation for one-time social insurance benefit, but it does not address the limit of maximum social insurance benefit for the case where the time of social insurance contribution is less than one year, as mentioned in the generated question and original text. The generated answer is off-topic and does not provide relevant information to answer the question asked."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a list of different conditions for receiving social insurance benefits, whereas the original answer specifically talks about a situation where the time for social insurance payment is less than a year and provides information about the amount of social insurance benefits. The two answers discuss different topics and do not share any relevant information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is extremely similar to the original answer. Both answers are direct quotes from the same regulation, and they provide the exact same information and formulas. The only difference is the format, as the generated answer is a direct response to the question, while the original answer is part of a larger text."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant as it mentions the phrase 'chế độ phụ cấp' which is also present in the original answer. Additionally, it discusses the condition for receiving this allowance, which is similar to the original answer's sentence structure. However, the generated answer also provides more information and details not present in the original answer, making it less relevant overall."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, which is a perfect match. The generated question asking about Nghị định này is also relevant to the original context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer's topic of 'viên chức' (civil servants) receiving a stipend, but misinterprets the original answer's context. The original answer specifies that 'viên chức làm việc tại huyện đảo Trường Sa' (civil servants working in Trường Sa district) receive a stipend, while the generated answer focuses on the regulating unit (đơn vị sự nghiệp công lập) without considering the specific location mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of its content, mentioning that employees working at Trường Sa island enjoy a certain level of allowance. However, the generated question asks about the level of allowance, whereas the original answer mentions the application of a regulation (Nghị định) on allowance. The generated answer does not fully address the same context and scope as the original answer, which is why it is classified as PARTLY_RELEVANT rather than RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer because it correctly identifies the fine range for illegal activities related to driving a motor vehicle without sufficient lighting.
