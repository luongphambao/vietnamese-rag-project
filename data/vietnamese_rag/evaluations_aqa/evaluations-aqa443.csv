Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer. It responds to the generated question and provides a relevant answer, but it only addresses a specific aspect of the original answer. The original answer discusses the necessity of maintaining a sufficient balance in the account to pass through other electronic toll collection stations, whereas the generated answer focuses on what to do when the account balance is insufficient. It lacks the broader context and essential details of the original answer, making it PARTLY_RELEVANT rather than RELEVANT."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct response to the generated question, but it does not provide any information related to the original answer. The original answer discusses the process of registration and payment for road usage fees, while the generated answer talks about the installation of a toll tag and the date after which it becomes mandatory. The topics are completely unrelated, making the generated answer non-relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially discusses the condition for deducting money from the account of the vehicle owner, but it is not accurate. The original text mentions that the service provider will deduct the fee at the time of registration, whereas the generated answer states that the account needs to be depleted before it can be subtracted. Although both answers touch on the topic, the generated answer lacks the essential detail and context, making it only partly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, covering the same information and providing the same details. The format and wording are also very similar, indicating a high level of similarity and relevance between the two."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the content of the original answer in mentioning the involvement of different groups, such as 'cha mẹ, giáo viên, cán bộ và sinh viên trong trường'. However, it fails to capture the specific details about the composition of the council, including 'đại diện cộng đồng dân cư, đại diện chính quyền địa phương cấp xã và người góp vốn xây dựng'. The generated answer also does not provide a direct response to the original question, which asks about who has the right to participate in the council, whereas the generated answer provides a general statement about the possible members of the council."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the question about the responsibilities of a brokerage agency for a public share purchase offering, but it includes some additional information that is not directly related to the original answer. Specifically, it provides details about the operation of a brokerage agency, including the requirements for operating a business and the definition of different types of securities, which are not mentioned in the original answer. While the generated answer does touch on some relevant topics, it is not a direct response to the original answer and therefore is only partly relevant."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses specific responsibilities of the agent in the case of a public offering by issuing new shares, while the original answer provides a broader overview of the agent's duties in public offerings. The generated answer focuses on the agent's role in releasing the account of the commercial entity, notifying the entity, and reporting to the competent authority, which is not related to the original answer's mention of ensuring the acquirer has sufficient funds to participate in the public offering."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly quotes the original answer, stating the exact fine range of 100,000 to 300,000 Vietnamese dong for the crime of forcing a child to divorce. The answer maintains the same context and provides the same information as the original answer, making it highly relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it pertains to the punishment for the same illegal act (ép buộc con gái ly hôn của cha mẹ). Although the range of the fine is different (300,000-500,000 instead of 100,000-300,000), the context and the topic of the answer are the same."
