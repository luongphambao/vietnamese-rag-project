Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the information provided in the original answer, including the exact date, time, and location mentioned."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, with the same information about the location and time of the accident, indicating that the generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is PARTLY_RELEVANT as it contains some relevant information about accidents, but is not directly related to the original answer. The original answer specifically mentions a serious accident in TP.HCM, while the generated answer mentions accidents in different locations (Hà Nội, Đắk Lắk, and Sơn La), which are not relevant to the original answer. The generated answer also includes incorrect information about the location and time of the original accident."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the same information as the original answer, including the specific location (phường 22, quận Bình Thạnh) and the city (TP.HCM). The answer is a direct extraction from the original answer, indicating a high level of relevance."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is about Phường 22 belonging to quận Nam Từ Liêm, which is different from the original answer that describes a serious traffic accident that occurred in Phường 22, quận Bình Thạnh. The two pieces of information are unrelated."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer exactly in terms of content and context. Both mention the current world ranking of Vietnam's national football team, which is 112, making the generated answer highly relevant to the original one."
RELEVANT,The generated answer 'Đội tuyển nào hiện đứng đầu bóng đá Đông Nam Á là Đội tuyển Việt Nam' is relevant because it directly answers the generated question 'Đội tuyển nào hiện đứng đầu bóng đá Đông Nam Á?' and provides the same information as the original answer. The original answer states 'Đội tuyển Việt Nam đang đứng đầu Đông Nam Á' and the generated answer confirms this by specifying that Vietnam is the top team in Southeast Asia.
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a repeated version of the question, rather than providing a relevant answer to the original statement. It does not offer any meaningful information about the ranking of Vietnam in East Asia or the world, and is not related to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it provides information about the number of teams in Đông Nam Á, which is related to the original answer's mention of Đông Nam Á. However, the generated answer does not address the original answer's mention of Việt Nam's ranking and instead provides a new piece of information not present in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately matches the original answer, which provides the world ranking of Vietnam in the FIFA ranking. The similarity between the original and generated answers is high, and the context and content are consistent, making the generated answer relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately states the score and who won the match (U23 Việt Nam) which is the main information from the original answer. It does not include any additional details mentioned in the original answer, but it still provides the core information asked in the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer, as it provides a detailed account of the event where Công Phượng scored a double and led U23 Việt Nam to a 2-1 win over U23 Thailand in the M-150 Cup. The generated answer not only mentions the score, but also provides additional context about the game, including the fact that Công Phượng's double helped U23 Việt Nam finish third in the tournament. The only difference is that the generated answer does not explicitly ask the question 'why', but instead provides a factual summary of the event. However, this does not detract from the overall relevance and accuracy of the generated answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains entirely different information, specifying a match between Brazil and Argentina, while the original answer describes a match between U23 Vietnam and U23 Thailand, making the generated answer highly irrelevant to the original one."
