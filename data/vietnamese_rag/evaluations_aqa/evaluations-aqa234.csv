Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions a wrong date (4/8) and a different location (which is not mentioned in the original answer), indicating that the answer is not relevant to the original question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer by providing the correct hour range (17, 17:30, 18, 18:30) but omits the specific time (17h40) and exact date (7/5). The answer lacks precision and specificity compared to the original answer, which provides a precise time and date."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly correct, but it's more or less a duplicate of the original answer. The only difference is that the question mentions 'hỗ trợ chạy bằng điện' (support running on electricity) which is not explicitly mentioned in the original answer. The answer still provides the same information as the original answer, which makes it partly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer appears to be a partial duplicate of the generated question, which asks about the distance the Project One can travel on electricity. The original answer mentions that the car can travel 32 km on pure electric mode, but the generated answer does not provide any specific information about this distance. While the generated answer is related to the topic, it does not provide new or relevant information, making it only partly relevant compared to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer perfectly matches the original answer in terms of content and context, with a similar sentence structure and identical information. The only difference is in the question posed, but this does not affect the relevance of the generated answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly contradicts the original answer, stating that the Project One cannot operate in electric mode, whereas the original answer mentions that it can operate in electric mode for approximately 32 km. The question itself asks about the distance, but the answer provides a false statement, making it non-relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant as it mentions the use of an electric motor in the Super Project One, which matches the context of the original answer. However, the generated answer mistakenly claims that the car can run indefinitely, whereas the original answer states it can run for a specific distance of 32 km on electric power mode. The generated answer lacks specificity and accuracy compared to the original answer, which is why it's not fully relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately restates the information provided in the original answer. It correctly identifies Bà Lâm Nữ as the legal representative of Công ty TNHH Thiên Ngọc Minh Uy, which is in line with the original answer. The only difference is that the original answer mentions the additional fact that she contributed 5 billion VND, which is not present in the generated answer. However, the core information about Bà Lâm Nữ's role remains the same, making the generated answer relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question, but it is not irrelevant either. It acknowledges that the relevant information is not mentioned in the case, which shows some understanding of the context. However, it does not provide the actual amount of the capital contribution, which is the point of the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer in terms of content, providing the same information about Bà Lâm Nữ being the legal representative of Công ty TNHH Thiên Ngọc Minh Uy. The format and phrasing are also similar, making it a relevant answer to the generated question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not provide any relevant information about the original answer. The original answer mentions that Bà Lâm Nữ contributed 5 billion VND as a legal representative of a company, whereas the generated answer is a nonsensical question and reply combination that doesn't even attempt to address the original question. The generated answer is entirely irrelevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the same information about Bà Lâm Nữ's role and contribution to the company. The response is accurate and relevant to the original question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is simply a repetition of the question, which does not contain any relevant information or attempt to provide an answer to the question. It does not provide the same information as the original answer, which lists the selected players for the Premier League's team of the week."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately reproduces the original answer, specifically identifying David de Gea's position in the top team of the 8th round of the Premier League according to GOAL. The generated answer matches the original answer word-for-word, making it relevant and accurate."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the correct information that Liverpool has two players, JOE GOMEZ and JOEL MATIP, selected for the best XI of the 8th round of the Premier League according to GOAL. The answer is relevant to the generated question, which is similar to the original question, as it asks about the number of Liverpool players selected for the best XI. The generated answer matches the original answer, providing the correct information about the players and their respective teams."
