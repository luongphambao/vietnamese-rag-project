Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer, but not exactly. The generated answer only focuses on the mobile phone service and omits the part about the fixed phone service. It also duplicates the sentence structure from the original answer, which makes it less similar."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a list of emergency services numbers that are correct, including 111 and 110, which are mentioned in the original answer as examples of numbers for emergency services. Although the generated answer is not a direct copy of the original answer, it accurately conveys the relevant information, making it 'RELEVANT'."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer. Both answers provide the same information about the duration of temporary suspension of work due to corruption, which is 90 days. The only difference is the wording and formatting, but the essence of the answer is identical."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question, providing details about the calculation of the suspension period, but the timeline and numbers mentioned are different from the original answer. The original answer specifies a 90-day suspension period from the decision date, whereas the generated answer mentions 05 working days or until the conclusion of the investigation."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer. Both answers mention the same regulation regarding temporal transfer of work location and the same timeframe of 90 days. The generated answer even provides additional information regarding the specific regulation being referred to (Khoản 2, Phụ lục of a document). The only difference is the explicit mention of the regulation being referred to in the generated answer, which is implicit in the original answer. Overall, the generated answer captures the main point and context of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information, but is not a direct answer to the generated question. The answer mentions the timeframe of 90 days, which matches the original answer. However, the context and wording are slightly different, and the generated answer does not fully address the original answer's specific content."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question, as it mentions the 90-day timeframe relevant to the temporary suspension and reassignment of duties. However, the generated answer merely restates the regulation rather than providing a specific answer to the question about when the 90-day period starting from the date of the decision begins, which is what the question is asking."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it provides the same information as the original answer, which is the levels of education within the general education system. Although the generated answer omits some information, such as early childhood education and vocational education, it still accurately conveys the core information asked for in the question, which is the levels of education within the general education system."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially covers the original answer by mentioning specific levels of education provided in vocational education (sơ cấp, trung cấp, cao đẳng, and other programs). However, it lacks comprehensive coverage and does not mention all education levels (big schooling, higher education) as well as provides a duplicate of the original question at the beginning."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions 'đại học' (university) which is mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer only mentions 'sau đại học' (post-graduate) which is not mentioned in the original answer. The original answer provides a comprehensive list of education levels, including 'đại học', but the generated answer only focuses on one part of it."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately includes the information from the original answer about the programs of training and vocational education, which is a specific part of the original answer. The only difference is that the original answer mentions all levels of education, including primary, secondary, and university levels, while the generated answer focuses on vocational education and does not include information on other levels of education, which is why it is considered relevant but not fully equivalent to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content, but lacks attention to the prompt's specific wording and structure. The original answer starts with 'Biểu hiện khoáng sản là tập hợp tự nhiên các khoáng chất có ích...' while the generated answer starts with 'Biểu hiện khoáng sản thường có những đặc điểm là...' which is a significant difference. However, the generated answer still conveys the same information about the characteristics of mineral manifestations, which constitutes a partial relevance to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, with almost identical content and structure. The only minor difference is the removal of the question 'Điều kiện gì để một tập hợp khoáng chất được coi là biểu hiện khoáng sản?' which is naturally included in the original answer. The generated answer provides a clear and concise explanation of what constitutes a mineral deposit, aligning well with the original answer and demonstrating a good understanding of the topic."
