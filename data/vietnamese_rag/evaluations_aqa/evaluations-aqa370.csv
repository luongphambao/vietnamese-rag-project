PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some information about the processing time of the dossier update, but it is not accurate and lacks specific details.

The generated answer includes a longer timeframe (30 days) and no mention of the electronic information portal."

RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately provides the same information as the original answer, including the specific days of the week and the hours of education. The only difference is the minor rephrasing of the sentence structure, which does not affect the overall relevance and content of the answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is directly extracted from the original answer, specifically the part that mentions the duration of a lesson. The generated answer accurately answers the generated question, providing a precise piece of information that can be found in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it mentions the same aspects of organizing law education and civic education for prisoners, specifically mentioning classes, disseminating educational materials through various means, and rewarding educational staff. The generated answer is concise and to the point, extracting the main points from the original answer. However, it misses some details and forms of education mentioned in the original answer, such as 'the ability of the educator and the awareness of the prisoner'."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the specific question asked, by mentioning additional methods of disseminating educational content to prisoners besides classroom organization. However, it does not provide a comprehensive answer and instead uses the same phrases and sentences as the original text to describe the various forms of education. The relevance is not entirely relevant because the generated answer does not add new information or insights, but rather rephrases the original text to fit the new context of the question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer, but it omits the crucial information about who needs to be informed and omits the second part of the original answer related to the beneficiary of the collateral, making it less comprehensive and relevant compared to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question, as it does mention that the car cannot be rented if it is being used as collateral. However, it also introduces a new point about the importance of registration and a valid license plate, which is not mentioned in the original answer. This additional information is relevant, but the generated answer does not directly answer the original question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not address the issue of informing the bank and the lessee about the fact that the car being rented is already being used as collateral. Instead, it focuses on the registration of the car when it is temporarily rented out, which is a different requirement. The generated answer does not provide any relevant information to the original answer, hence it is classified as NON_RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions the requirement to inform someone when renting a car that is already mortgaged to a bank.

The generated answer does not provide the full context and details provided in the original answer."

However, the answer also includes additional conditions that are not mentioned in the original answer, such as specific exceptions for foreign-registered vehicles entering Vietnam for tourism or business purposes. The overlap with the original answer is limited, and the additional information added noise to the answer, making it partly relevant but not entirely accurate."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of the fine range, but it omits the 'cảnh cáo' punishment option mentioned in the original answer and extends the fine range to 500,000 VND instead of 300,000 VND. Additionally, the generated answer does not mention the situation where the violator will face fines from 100,000 to 300,000 VND. Despite these inaccuracies, the generated answer still conveys the general idea that coercing family members out of their legal residence can result in a fine, which makes it partly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely matches the original answer, providing the specific fine ranges for the offense of forcing family members out of their lawful residence. The only minor difference is the rewording of 'độ chở' to 'đe dọa', but this does not affect the overall meaning or relevance of the answer."
