RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a nearly identical copy of the original answer, providing the same information and table structure. The only difference is the repeated question at the beginning, which is not a meaningful addition. The content and context of the generated answer are highly similar to the original answer, making it a relevant response."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions Indonesia, Brunei, Philippines, and Myanmar being grouped with a team, which is partially relevant to the original answer. However, the original answer specifically mentions 'Đội tuyển Việt Nam' (Vietnam team) and 'Đội tuyển Thái Lan' (Thailand team), whereas the generated answer incorrectly uses 'U.22 Thái Lan' instead, which is not present in the original answer. The generated answer also does not provide the correct grouping, pairing these four countries with Thailand's U-22 team instead of Vietnam's team. A more accurate answer would have been 'Indonesia, Brunei, Philippines, and Myanmar are in the same group with Vietnam.'"
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions U22 Việt Nam which is incorrect and not mentioned in the original answer. The original answer talks about Lào, while the generated answer introduces a new team that doesn't exist in the original context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially refers to the context of the competition (Futsal Đông Nam Á 2017), but it only provides information on the number of groups/blocks (4) and does not specifically address the teams or group assignments mentioned in the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is about the foreign investment in Vietnam during the first half of the year, which is unrelated to the original answer discussing the teams in the Southeast Asian Football Championship.

RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer exactly, providing the same list of names and stating the same fact that 4 new players were called up to the U22 Vietnam team."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant because it provides a list of players who have been called up, but it does not answer the specific question about who is the defender that was called up. The generated answer does not contain the name of the specific defender mentioned in the original answer, Trần Văn Kiên."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions one of the new faces being summoned to U22 Vietnam, Tran Van Kien, which is also mentioned in the original answer. However, it only focuses on the defender and does not mention the other new faces (Nguyen Anh Tai, Lam Ti Phong, and Chuong Ngoc Quang) mentioned in the original answer, which makes it not entirely relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially tackles the original answer's topic, which is about Châu Ngọc Quang, a Vietnamese football player. Although the generated answer mentions Châu Ngọc Quang, it does not provide any relevant or useful information about their full name, which was the specific question asked. Instead, it seems to be a rejection of the question, stating that there is no information available. The generated answer lacks the specific detail required and only provides a vague answer, which is why it is considered partly relevant."
