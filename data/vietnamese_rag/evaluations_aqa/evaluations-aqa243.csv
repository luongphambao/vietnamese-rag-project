Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a different location for the accident, which is at Nguyen Huu Canh Bridge in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City, whereas the original answer states it occurred at Hua Tat village, Van Hoa district, Son La province. The two locations are unrelated, making the generated answer non-relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'Số người bị thương sau tai nạn là 3 người' is highly relevant to the original answer 'Vụ tai nạn xảy ra ở địa phận bản Hua Tạt, xã Vân Hồ, huyện Vân Hồ, tỉnh Sơn La và đã gây thương tích cho 3 người.' because it directly answers the original answer's content about the number of people injured in the accident."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not address the original question about the fuel consumption of Toyota Prius and instead provides information about the market price of Toyota Prius abroad. The topic, question, and answer are unrelated."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer as it gives a specific value of 2.5 lít/100 km for the fuel consumption of Toyota Prius outside the city, which is similar to the range provided in the original answer (2.5 lít/100 km on highway). However, the generated answer does not directly address the original question, which was about the fuel consumption outside the city, but the generated answer only provides a specific value without further context or details."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant as it mentions the correct fuel efficiency of Toyota Prius, specifically on the highway, which matches with the original answer. However, the generated answer only focuses on the comparison with other cars, which is not present in the original answer. Moreover, the sentence structure and phrase choices (e.g., 'Tiêu thụ nhiên liệu ít hơn xe khác') are not identical to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly answers the question about the lowest fuel efficiency of Toyota Prius, which is 2.5 lít/100 km, matching the information provided in the original answer, which states that Toyota Prius can reach 2.5 lít/100 km on an expressway. The context and content of the generated answer are highly relevant to the original answer, indicating good accuracy."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant as it provides some information about the fuel efficiency of the Toyota Prius, which is related to the original answer. However, the generated answer is missing the key point about the hybrid system being the reason for the fuel efficiency, which is a crucial detail mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is identical to the original answer, it is presented as a question instead of a statement. The content is relevant, but the format is different, which affects the overall similarity and relevance."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not relate to the original statement about Leona Nguyễn being able to walk on a beam with a height of less than 1 meter. The original statement seems to be about her acrobatic/circus skills, whereas the generated answer is about a TV program she participated in, making it completely unrelated and non-relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a repetition of the original statement, indicating a high level of relevance and similarity between the two. The context and content of the original answer are accurately reflected in the generated answer, suggesting that the RAG system has successfully retrieved and generated a relevant response."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions Minh Tú, who is another person who can overcome obstacles in the program, which is loosely related to the original answer mentioning Leona Nguyễn who can pass obstacles. However, the generated answer digresses from the original context by mentioning a specific episode of the program and providing more details, making it only partly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the exact same information and format. The only difference is the format of the generated question, which is a reworded version of the original answer. This suggests that the generated answer is a direct copy of the original answer, achieving high relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is the exact original answer, which means it is relevant in the sense that it provides the correct information. However, it also asks the same question as the original question, which is unusual for an answer and makes it only partly relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct repetition of the original answer, providing the same information about the price of the new Renault Duster model. The question and answer both focus on the price of the vehicle, which is a clear match with the original answer."
