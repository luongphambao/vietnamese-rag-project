The overall content and context of the generated answer are very similar to the original answer, making it relevant to the original answer."

The original answer highlights the accessibility of the feature to global developers, whereas the generated answer implies that the feature is accessible to anyone or anything ('ai'). This difference in meaning and context makes the generated answer only partly relevant to the original answer."
