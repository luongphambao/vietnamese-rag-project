Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relevant because it is close to the original text, which mentions the responsibility of the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism in reviewing the design plans for conservation and restoration of cultural relics. However, the generated answer only mentions the Minister's role in reviewing the plans, whereas the original text mentions the Minister's responsibility in deciding the content and scope of review, which is a more specific and detailed responsibility."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately provides the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (Bộ trưởng Bộ Văn hóa, Thể thao và Du lịch) in regulating the content and authority of reviewing design plans for preserving, restoring, and conserving cultural relics, which is a topic discussed in the original answer. Although the generated answer does not exactly match the original answer, it addresses the same issue and conveys relevant information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it mentions Nghị định (Decree) number 27/2012/NĐ-CP, which is a relevant concept in the context. However, the generated answer is missing the crucial information that the decree is related to the design of the construction, conservation, restoration, and heritage of cultural relics, as stated in the original answer. Additionally, the generated answer only mentions one directive (Nghệ định số 27/2012/NĐ-CP) without providing other necessary information as mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer refers to the same topic as the original answer, which is the timing of the program/ban hành. However, it doesn't directly answer the question, but rather provides a passage that discusses the timing of publishing certain documents. The answer is partially relevant as it touches on the topic, but it's not directly responsive to the question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a statement that the information on the timeframe for the Program's issuance is not available in context 1 and 2, and therefore cannot be answered. This is unrelated to the original answer provided, which specifies a specific date (31/12) for the issuance of a program. The generated answer does not address the same topic or provide similar information as the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not address the requested deadline for issuing a program at all. Instead, it provides information about the timeline for issuing a decision of the Prime Minister and the preparation of a report. The two are unrelated, making the generated answer non-relevant to the original question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer. The original answer discusses the requirements for getting a certificate for seafarer crew, specifically mentioning the training program for officers at sea.

The topics and contexts are distinct, making the generated answer non-relevant to the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses the content of a different document (Giấy chứng nhận huấn luyện nghiệp vụ cơ bản) and its components, which has no direct connection to the conditions required for getting a certificate to work as a maritime officer (original answer). The generated answer does not address the requirements mentioned in the original answer, making it non-relevant."
