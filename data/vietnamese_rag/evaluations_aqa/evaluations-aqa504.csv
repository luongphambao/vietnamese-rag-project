Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer in that it also discusses a situation where someone's driving license is in question. However, the generated answer provides more specific details and exceptions, which deviate from the original answer's direct statement that a person cannot obtain a new permit during the time their license is revoked. The generated answer also shifts the focus from the general rule to a specific scenario, which reduces the relevance to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it discusses the impact of the time period during which the driving license is revoked on the reissuance of the license. However, the original answer is more general, stating that any individual or organization cannot apply for a new or replacement license during the time their license is revoked. The generated answer provides additional specificity and details about the time period and the process, but it is not directly addressing the original answer's statement."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially corresponds to the original answer. Both answers discuss the consequence of having one's rights being revoked, specifically related to the right to possess a license. However, the generated answer is more focused on the specific right to exchange a driving license, whereas the original answer provides a broader context, mentioning both license and certificate, and highlighting the inability to apply for a new or revised license/certificate during the revocation period."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer. The original answer discusses the restrictions on a person or organization's ability to apply for a renewal or issuance of a license or certificate during the period of license suspension. The generated answer, on the other hand, asks a question about the restrictions on renewing a driver's license during a suspension period and provides an answer that discusses the duration allowed for people on probation to leave their residential location. The two answers address different topics and are not related to each other."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a slight expansion of the original answer, providing more context about the circumstances under which the fine is imposed (ài xế điều khiển ô tô xếp hàng chờ trước trạm thu phí trên một làn xe chờ dài lớn hơn 200 xe). The content is still related to the fine amount, and the additional information does not alter the main meaning of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer 30.000.000 đồng đến 40.000.000 đồng is partly relevant to the original answer Phạt tiền từ 30.000.000 đồng đến 40.000.000 đồng. The range of fine is correctly retrieved and presented in the generated answer, but it is not entirely relevant as it is applied to a specific context (over 200 vehicles waiting to pay toll) whereas the original answer is a general range of fine."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a partially relevant result, as it mentions a fine of 8,000,000 dong, which is within the range of the original answer of 30,000,000 - 40,000,000 dong. However, the context and question asked are slightly different, and the generated answer does not exactly match the original answer in terms of specific range. The original answer provides a broader range of possible fines, whereas the generated answer provides a more specific lower limit of the fine."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer by mentioning the same range of fine amounts (30,000,000 to 40,000,000 VND). However, the original answer provides a general statement about the fine range, while the generated answer provides a more specific scenario-based explanation. The generated answer does not fully capture the intent of the original answer, which is a simple statement of the fine range, but only provides an example that supports the original statement."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by providing information about the fines related to the scene, but it does not directly answer the question about the limit on the fine fee. The answer also contains additional information that is not relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer provides information about how to retrieve the vehicle registration certificate, it focuses on the process of renewing or getting a duplicate certificate, whereas the original answer specifically mentions regaining a lost certificate. The generated answer partially addresses the context of the original answer, but not entirely, as it does not explicitly mention the condition of the lost certificate."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer. The generated question and the original question are identical, which means they share the same context and intent. The generated answer provides the same information as the original answer, but in a slightly different format."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it directly addresses the same topic and provides the same information. The generated answer is essentially a rephrased version of the original answer, which contains the same key points and details. The relevance is high due to the exact match in content, context, and intent."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions 'giấy đăng ký xe máy trả góp' which is relevant to the original answer, however, it only partially addresses the context. The original answer mentions 'bị mất' (lost) and provides a solution for replacing the lost document, whereas the generated answer only mentions when the document can be replaced, without mentioning the condition of being lost."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer, as both answers discuss the same topic (receiving a new certificate of registration if the original one is lost) and use similar language. However, the generated answer is more specific, focusing on a single procedure (submitting a request to re-issue the certificate) whereas the original answer provides a broader statement about the possibility of re-issuance. The generated answer lacks the nuance and context provided in the original answer, which considers the possibility of re-issuance rather than explicitly stating the necessary procedure."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer. The original answer discusses the possibility of obtaining a passport and the authority responsible for issuing it, whereas the generated answer consists of a repeated question. The content and context are completely mismatched."
