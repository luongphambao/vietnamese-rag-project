Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it discusses the same topic of avoiding conflicts of interest in representation in a civil transaction. The generated answer provides specific examples and explanations of how to define the scope of representation and notify the counterparty, which is similar in content to the original answer. Although the tone and structure are different, the key points and concepts presented in the generated answer align with the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it still deals with the punishment for not building a sustainable forest management plan. However, the generated answer provides a different fine range (40,000,000 - 60,000,000 VND) compared to the original answer (1,000,000 - 3,000,000 VND). The generated answer also requires the plan to be submitted to authorities, which is not mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer's wording and context are different from the original answer, making it partly relevant but not identical."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it mentions a specific type of violating behavior (lấn, chức chiếm rừng phòng hộ) and a specific penalty range (1.000.000 to 3.000.000 đồng), which matches the original answer's structure and context. However, the generated answer is not fully relevant because it only addresses a specific scenario (diện tích dưới 2.000 m2) which is not mentioned in the original answer, and it also does not mention the more general rule about not building or implementing the approved forest management plan."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer does touch upon the topic of punishment for not implementing a sustainable forest management plan, it provides a negative statement that the punishment is not mentioned in the provided documents, whereas the original answer specifies the fine range. The generated answer only partially addresses the original question and does not provide the same level of specificity as the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer by mentioning the roles of the chủ rừng (forest owner) and the person being given land use rights by the state. However, it does not specifically mention the level of punishment for failing to develop, implement, or violate the approved forest management plan, which is the main content of the original answer. The answer also seems to be unrelated to the penalty for non-compliance with forest management plans."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partly addresses the same topic as the original answer, which is about managing and handling violations of forest management regulations. However, the tone and context of the generated answer are quite different from the original. The original answer provides a specific range of fines for not implementing sustainable forest management plans, whereas the generated answer mentions a broader topic of violations of forest management regulations and provides specific fines for a specific type of violation. The generated answer does not directly relate to the original question and does not provide the same level of detail and specificity as the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it talks about a similar concept (sanctions/fines) and provides a range of values. However, the values themselves are different and slightly off from the original answer. The generated answer also includes additional context (sử dụng vốn công ty nhà nước) that is not present in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides a detailed explanation for the fine range (30.000.000 đồng to 40.000.000 đồng) against the company's wasteful use of state-owned capital. While the generated answer includes additional information, the core content of the fine range is consistent with the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"While the generated answer mentions the same topic as the original answer (quy định về phạt tiền cho hành vi lãng phí vốn công ty nhà nước), it fails to provide a specific answer to the original question ('Bộ luật nào quy định về phạt tiền cho hành vi lãng phí vốn công ty nhà nước'). Instead, it provides a detailed description of the regulations regarding the use and management of state-owned assets. Although the related topic is mentioned, the generated answer does not directly answer the original question, making it only partly relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides the same range of monetary values ('30.000.000 đồng đến 40.000.000 đồng') and explains the context of applying this limit to state-owned company's misuse of funds, which matches the original answer's content. The sentence structure and wording are also similar, indicating a high degree of similarity between the two."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a specific number (70.000.000 đồng) as the maximum fine for the misuse of state-owned company funds, but it is not directly related to the original answer which provides a range (30.000.000-40.000.000 đồng). The generated answer also does not specifically answer the original question which asks for the maximum fine, but instead provides a value that is not within the mentioned range."
