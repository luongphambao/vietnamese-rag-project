Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides the same conditions for obtaining a certificate of professional competence for Oiler, including the requirement for graduating from a middle-level degree program, completing basic training, and having enough sea time or training experience. The only difference is that the generated answer assumes that the applicant is a junior-level graduate, while the original answer lists both junior and higher-level graduates. The content and structure of the generated answer are similar to those of the original answer, making it highly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question, as it mentions a possible alternative to the original requirement of 'thời gian đi biển' (sea time) for obtaining the certification. However, it fails to mention the other two requirements mentioned in the original answer, which are 'tốt nghiệp chuyên ngành' (graduation from a relevant field) and 'có giấy chứng nhận huấn luyện nghiệp vụ cơ bản' (holding a basic vocational training certificate). Additionally, the generated answer uses different wording and doesn't provide a comprehensive explanation of the requirements."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, providing the same information about the authority's jurisdiction in issuing certificates for foreign securities companies' representative offices in Vietnam. The generated answer is a direct response to the generated question, accurately conveying the same meaning as the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides detailed information about the conditions for a foreign securities company's representative office to be granted a business registration certificate. This is closely related to the concept of Ủy ban Chứng khoán Nhà nước (State Securities Commission), which is mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer not only includes the relevant information but also provides a clear and concise description of the conditions. Although it does not exactly match the original answer, the content is highly relevant and consistent with the context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the context of the original answer. The generated answer mentions 'Bộ quản lý ngành, lĩnh vực' (Ministry or department of industry, sector...), which is related to the concept of 'Ủy ban Chứng khoán Nhà nước' (State Securities Commission), a government agency responsible for licensing and supervision. However, the generated answer does not directly answer the question provided and lacks the specific information about the State Securities Commission. Therefore, the relevance is PARTLY_RELEVANT."

The generated answer does not add any new information, but it accurately summarizes the same information provided in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it clearly states that only the agency with jurisdiction can report drug addiction for an official to be disciplined and dismissed. However, it lacks the additional information provided in the original answer about the requirement for a medical examination or confirmation from a medical facility, which is a crucial aspect of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is semantically similar to the original answer. Both answers mention the requirement of having a confirmation from a healthcare facility or a notification from a competent authority for a public official to be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment, due to drug addiction. The generated answer is a condensed version of the original answer, but it still conveys the same information and is relevant to the original question."
