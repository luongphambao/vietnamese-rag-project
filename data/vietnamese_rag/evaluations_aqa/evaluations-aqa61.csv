RELEVANT,"The generated answer largely overlaps with the original answer, rephrasing the main points about the cultural similarities between Vietnam and Armenia, such as their unique cultural heritage, Western cultural influence, and people's willingness to adopt new things while preserving traditional culture. The only difference is the slightly different wording and sentence structure, but the content remains largely identical to the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides information about an address in HCMC, which is completely unrelated to the original answer that talks about a resort in Bahamas designed for people with obesity. The context, location, and topic are all different, making the generated answer non-relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the original answer, providing the same information about the resort being designed for overweight people and specifically tailored to support weights up to 254kg. The answer also mentions the resort's goal of helping guests feel more confident when wearing swimwear, which is a key point in the original answer. The content and context of the generated answer are highly similar to the original answer, making it relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately reproduces the maximum weight capacity of 254kg mentioned in the original answer, which is directly related to the question. Although the generated answer is not exactly identical to the original answer, it conveys the same essential information, making it relevant to the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the special design for people with a weight of up to 254kg and the focus on helping customers with weight issues feel more confident when swimming. Instead, the answer describes general resort amenities, which differs significantly from the original answer's focus on the resort's features for people with obesity."

RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the same information and details. The only difference is that the generated question frames the original answer in a different way. This suggests that the RAG system was able to not only retrieve relevant information but also generate a coherent and accurate answer that resembles the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not directly match the original answer, but it is related to the context of the original answer. The generated answer is a response to the provided question, which is about the location of the illegal act, but the answer does not provide any specific location. The original answer describes the scenario, while the generated answer provides a statement that lacks important information. The connection between the two is that they are both related to the investigation or description of the illegal act, but the generated answer does not provide sufficient information to match the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, including the same sequence of events and vocabulary. This suggests that the RAG system has accurately retrieved and generated the correct response matching the original answer."

However, the answer does not provide any information directly related to the original answer's content, which makes it not entirely relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some information related to the original answer, as it states that the original answer does not provide information about the source material of Melsmon.

RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct summary of the original answer, containing the same list of benefits and effects of Melsmon on the skin.
