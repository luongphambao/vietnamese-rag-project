Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it directly answers the question about who has the necessary qualifications to perform site supervision and construction management, which is mentioned in the original answer. The answer is also largely extracted from the original text, showing a good understanding of the content."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information related to the original answer, as both mention the importance of storing records related to house ownership. However, the generated answer goes beyond the scope of the original answer by providing specific types of records that should be kept, whereas the original answer focuses on the general requirement for records to be kept. Furthermore, the generated answer does not directly address the original question, which asks about the specific records related to a separate house that need to be kept by the investor, whereas the generated answer provides general information on records related to house ownership."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it mentions some of the tasks that the original answer encourages the investor to perform, such as organizing supervising construction, storing files, and ensuring safety. However, the additional suggestions in the generated answer, such as 'cụ thể hóa và thực hiện chiến lược, kế hoạch phát triển các ngành công nghiệp trọng điểm, công nghiệp hỗ trợ trong từng thời kỳ', are not mentioned in the original answer and are not directly related to the original topic. Overall, the generated answer captures some of the main points of the original answer but also introduces additional, unrelated information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the essence of the original answer, but not entirely. It mentions the electronic VAT invoice being used when sending to the customer (bao gồm cả trường hợp hóa đơn được khởi tạo từ máy tính tiền có kết nối chuyển dữ liệu điện tử với cơ quan thuế), which is present in the original answer. However, it fails to mention the obligation to calculate VAT according to the method of deduction, which is a crucial aspect of the original answer. It also includes additional information about the tax agency issuing a code before the invoice is created, which is not present in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct answer to the generated question, which is a subset of the information presented in the original answer. The generated answer accurately states that the electronic invoice created from a POS machine connected to the tax authority is indeed an e-invoice VAT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides relevant information about VAT in electronic invoices, although it does not provide the exact method of calculating VAT. It correctly states that the original text does not mention the method of calculating VAT, which aligns with the original answer's mention of VAT in the context of invoices. The generated answer's lack of focus on the exact method asked for in the question is what prevents it from being 'PARTLY_RELEVANT', but it still provides relevant information that is connected to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides a similar explanation of the differences between hóa đơn điện tử VAT and hóa đơn VAT thông thường. The generated answer mentions the use of mã xác thực from cơ quan thuế, which is also present in the original answer, and provides a comprehensive explanation of the characteristics of hóa đơn điện tử VAT. The context and content of the generated answer seem to be accurate and match the original answer's description of hóa đơn điện tử VAT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content, but not in terms of context. The generated answer correctly states that people with full capacity for civil acts can have someone else guardian them when they need protection, and mentions the conditions for choosing a guardian. However, the generated answer flips the concept by making it seem like the individual needs to be controlled by someone else, whereas the original answer explains that the individual has the capacity to choose their own guardian. The generated answer also does not capture the nuance of having the power to choose a guardian, but instead presents it as a necessity. Therefore, while the generated answer has some relevant information, it does not accurately convey the original answer's message."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content, but lacks context and focuses mainly on the requirements for selecting a guardian, whereas the original answer discusses the rights of individuals and legal entities to choose their own guardian. While the generated answer mentions some similar points, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the topic and lacks the clarifying details present in the original answer."
