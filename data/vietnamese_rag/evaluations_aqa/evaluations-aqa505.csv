Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the specific conditions for issuing a temporary travel document to go to the bordering province of Campuchia, which aligns with the context of the original answer, which mentions 'có nhu cầu sang tỉnh biên giới đối diện của Campuchia công tác' (can work in the bordering province of Campuchia). The generated answer provides detailed information on the required conditions and procedures, making it highly relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer by describing a type of document ('giấy thông hành') but not directly addressing the specific context of citizens traveling to a border province in Cambodia. While the generated answer mentions 'người lao động' (workers) and 'Công tác' (work), it lacks connection to the original answer's specific mention of 'sang tỉnh biên giới đối diện của Campuchia công tác' (traveling to a border province in Cambodia)."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer. Both answers mention the issuance of a paper of approval (in the original answer, it's mentioned as 'giấy thông hành') to Vietnamese citizens, although the generated answer provides more specific details about the cases (official business, tourism, or visiting relatives) as compared to the original answer which only provides a general context ('sang tỉnh biên giới đối diện của Campuchia công tác'). The generated answer accurately conveys the relevant information and is relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of relevance. It correctly mentions the province of An Giang being adjacent to Cambodia and allows citizens to obtain a border pass. However, it does not provide the same level of detail as the original answer, which mentions that citizens can obtain a border pass if they need to work in the bordering province of Cambodia. The generated answer only provides information about the province and the border pass, but not the general condition of needing to work in the bordering province."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the relevance of the original answer by mentioning violations related to labor safety, environment, and underage labor, which are forms of punishable behavior. However, the generated answer lacks the specific detail about the fine range of 200,000 to 300,000 VND mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer also goes beyond the original answer by providing more general information about the type of violations. Therefore, the relevance is PARTLY_RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it provides a range of fine (80.000 - 120.000 đồng) but not the exact range (200.000 - 300.000 đồng) mentioned in the original answer. The context of driving on the wrong road is correct, but the specific penalty range is not accurately reflected."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer provides additional information about the fine amount, it still answers the original question about the fine range for leaving a motorbike on the sidewalk. The fine range mentioned in the generated answer (100.000 - 300.000 VND) is consistent with the original answer (200.000 - 300.000 VND). The additional information about the agency's ability to seize the violator's vehicle is supplementary but not conflicting with the original answer, making the generated answer relevant to the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a range of 100.000 Đô la to 200.000 Đô la, which is completely different from the range provided in the original answer (200.000 đồng to 300.000 đồng). The content and context of the two answers do not match, and the generated answer is incorrect."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a list of specific examples of traffic violations that may be fined between 200,000 and 300,000 VNĐ. Although it follows a different structure and format than the original answer, the content is directly related to the original answer, which mentions the same fine range. The generated answer also provides concrete examples of traffic violations, which is similar to the original answer's concise statement of the fine range."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original question about the necessary positions in a securities company. However, it provides more details and specific roles within those positions, which are not mentioned in the original answer. While the roles mentioned in the original answer (a, b, c, and d) are not fully expanded in the generated answer, some roles mentioned in the generated answer (e.g. Trưởng phòng giao dịch, Nhân viên giao dịch, etc.) do align with the original answer. The generated answer provides more nuance and depth to the original answer, but it does not cover all the necessary positions mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly related to the original answer as it mentions some responsibilities of a securities company, such as ensuring the safety of customers' accounts and providing support. However, the specific requirements mentioned in the original answer (a, b, c, and d) are not mentioned in the generated answer, which reduces its relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions various types of consultation (về đầu tư, về quản trị kinh doanh, về tài chính, và về thuế) provided by the company to its customers, but it does not directly address the specific positions as mentioned in the original answer (a) Tư vấn, giải thích hợp đồng và thực hiện các thủ tục mở tài khoản giao dịch chứng khoán cho khách hàng; b) Tư vấn giao dịch chứng khoán cho khách hàng; c) Nhận lệnh, kiểm soát lệnh giao dịch chứng khoán của khách hàng; d) Trưởng các bộ phận liên quan đến nghiệp vụ môi giới chứng khoán. Although some information overlaps, the original answer is more focused on the roles and responsibilities of a brokerage company, whereas the generated answer provides a broader overview of the services offered."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions the role of a securities company, which is a key point in the original answer. However, it does not specifically mention the required positions in a securities company, which is the main focus of the original answer. The generated answer also provides additional information about the company's services and role in managing and supervising securities transactions, which is not present in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions a regulatory body, SEC - Securities and Exchange Commission, which is responsible for overseeing the functions of the securities market, including the brokerage companies. The answer partially relates to the original answer's d) Trưởng các bộ phận liên quan đến nghiệp vụ môi giới chứng khoán by mentioning the chief of a department related to securities brokerage. However, the relevance is not direct and lacks clarity, as the generated answer does not specifically provide the person responsible for those departments."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question, enumerating specific scenarios where the subject does not enjoy interest on deposits at the State Treasury. However, it lacks the context about the implementation and regulation at the State Treasury, which is present in the original answer. The generated answer does not exactly match the original text, but it conveys some relevant information."
