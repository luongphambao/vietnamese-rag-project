RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately lists symptoms of central nervous system involvement associated with fever in the context of viral Japanese encephalitis, which is the same focus as the original answer. Although the format and wording differ, the content corresponds well to the original answer, including both generic symptoms (e.g., numb headache, nausea, vomiting) and more specific ones (e.g., personality changes, convulsions). Only a few minor details are missing, such as 'lú lẫn' (dizziness) from the original answer, but overall, the generated answer is relevant and similar to the original."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer. Both answers describe the typical neurological symptoms of Japanese encephalitis, including headache, vomiting, confusion, altered mental state, and others. The generated answer is essentially a rephrased version of the original answer, but with a more focused question context. The relevance is high, and only minor variations in wording and organization distinguish the two answers."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely relevant to the original answer as it mentions the same symptoms associated with Japanese Encephalitis, including honeymoon, convulsions, hearing and speech disorders, hallucinations, amnesia, and even death. The generated answer only misses some of the symptoms mentioned in the original answer, such as nhức đầu dữ dội, buồn nôn và nôn mửa, cứng cổ, lú lẫn, mất định hướng, thay đổi nhân cách,  ... The answer still captures the overall context and severity of the illness, making it relevant and partially accurate."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides similar information and context as the original answer. Both answers discuss North Korea's capability to manufacture long-range missiles, including ICBMs, and mention specific examples of missiles developed by North Korea. The generated answer also mentions North Korea's ongoing technological development to improve its missiles' protection from the atmosphere and its potential to threaten the United States. While the generated answer includes additional details and specific examples of missiles, its core message and context are in line with the original answer, making it relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches with the original answer. The original answer mentions that North Korea has been able to produce an ICBM type missile, but the specific type is not explicitly mentioned. The generated answer however specifies that it is the KN-17 missile, which is partially relevant. However, the original text does not mention the KN-17 missile specifically, so it is not a direct match."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relevant because it mentions some specific information about North Korea's missile tests, such as the development of the Hwasong-14 missile and miniaturized nuclear weapons. However, the generated answer is not directly addressing the original answer's topics, such as the possibility of North Korea developing ICBMs capable of reaching the US, the challenges of protecting re-entry and guidance systems. The generated answer appears to be focused on providing general information about North Korea's missile program, rather than specifically responding to the original answer's questions or claims."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it provides a similar sentence structure and same information about the North Korean missile as the original answer. However, it lacks the specific details and explanations provided in the original answer, and the text is almost identical to the original question, which does not provide new insights or answers to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, which indicates a high level of relevance and accuracy. The generated answer provides the same information as the original answer, including the number of cancelled flights and the departure cities."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer by mentioning the same number of flights (2 from Hà Nội) and providing the correct destination (Ðài Loan). However, it also includes additional information that is not present in the original answer (flights from TP. Hồ Chí Minh), which reduces its relevance to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides detailed information about the cancelled flights from HCM to Taiwan, which is similar to the original answer. The only difference is that the original answer mentions that two flights from Hanoi were also cancelled, whereas the generated answer only focuses on the flights from HCM. The content and context of the generated answer are relevant to the original answer, providing further details about the cancellation of flights due to the impact of Typhoon Hating."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer simply rephrases the question, providing no meaningful information or relevance to the original answer. The original answer provides specific details about Vietnam Airlines canceling flights to Cao Hùng airport in Taiwan due to the impact of Storm Hai Teng, while the generated answer just reiterates the question and does not provide any similar information."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a set of questions, including the original question, rather than an answer. The generated text does not provide any relevant information in response to the original question, which asks about the number of flights affected by a storm. Instead, it repeats the original question, making it non-relevant to the original answer."
