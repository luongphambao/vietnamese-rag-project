Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer lacks any relevant information about the author of the book, whereas the original answer provides a specific detail about the award received by the book. The generated answer instead states that the author is not mentioned in the document, which is a tangential mention that does not provide any meaningful information that relates to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is almost identical to the original answer, which also mentions the book being awarded a prize by Ban độc giả and Nhà xuất bản Hội Nhà văn Pháp. The only difference is that the generated answer does not directly answer the question about the year, but instead rephrases the information from the original answer. However, the core information about the award is present in both answers."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the correct authors of the award, which is 'Ban độc giả và Nhà xuất bản Hội Nhà văn Pháp', which is the same as the original answer. Although the generated answer does not exactly match the original sentence structure and wording, it conveys the same information, making it relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides specific information about another film where Quốc Tuấn played the main role, which is relevant to the original answer. The generated answer also provides a concrete detail (the film title) which matches the expectations of the original question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer, as it provides a statement that the information about the author of the film 'Cô bé bên hồ' is not available in the database. The original answer mentioned that Diễn viên Quốc Tuấn acted as the main character in the film, which is a different topic and context from the generated question and answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer does not directly answer the question about the author of the film's script, it acknowledges that the information is not provided in the given context. This partial relevance is due to the generated answer addressing the uncertainty around the answer rather than providing the actual author's name."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it accurately responds to the generated question, providing the same information (price drop of 20%) and context (comparing to the peak price of 3,000 USD on 12/6). The only difference is the slight rephrasing of the sentence structure, but the core information remains the same as in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct quote from the original answer, which accurately answers the generated question.

RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it provides a reason why the price drop of Bitcoin is not unusual for investors, which is the same topic discussed in the original answer. The generated answer specifically mentions the timing of the drop and the experience of investors, which are also key points in the original answer. However, the generated answer is not an exact duplicate of the original answer, and some details are missing. Nevertheless, the response is still considered relevant because it provides a similar narrative and insights."
