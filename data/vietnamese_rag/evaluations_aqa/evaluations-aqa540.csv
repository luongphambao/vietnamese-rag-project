RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly responds to the generated question, which is a rephrased version of the original answer. The generated answer maintains the same content and context as the original answer, reproducing the same information about the fine range and the requirement to publicly disclose organizational management information of educational institutions."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is about the regulation related to publicizing information about educational institution management, which is unrelated to the original answer mentioning a fine range of 10,000,000 to 20,000,000 VND. The generated answer does not provide any information about the original topic, and there is no apparent connection between the two."

The generated answer provides a broader range of fine amounts (1,000,000 - 2,000,000 VND) compared to the original answer (300,000 - 500,000 VND)."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer by providing information on the types of people who must pay BHYT (social insurance).

Although the range of fine ($300,000 - $500,000) in the original answer is different from the range ($6,000,000 - $8,000,000) mentioned in the generated answer, the context and topic of the generated answer are related to the original question and answer."
