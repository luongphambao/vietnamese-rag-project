Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it directly addresses the specific scenario mentioned in the question, i.e., not implementing procedures for releasing national reserve items under 100,000,000 dong. The answer provides information on the specific range of fines for this scenario, which is closely related to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it correctly mentions 'cảnh cáo' as another form of punishment, which is present in the original answer. However, it only provides a limited amount of information and does not fully capture the scope of penalties mentioned in the original answer, which includes both 'phạt cảnh cáo' and 'phạt tiền'. The generated answer also does not provide a clear range of values for the penalties as mentioned in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer, as it provides the same information and penalty for not following the procedures for providing relief supplies within the stipulated time frame. The language and structure are also very similar, indicating a strong match between the generated and original answers."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of the core point being addressed, i.e., the punishment for not implementing the procedures for distributing national reserve goods. However, the generated answer lacks a crucial detail from the original answer, which is the fact that the punishment only applies to cases where the value of the reserve goods is under 100,000,000 dong. Additionally, the generated answer has a different range of fine values (2,000,000 to 30,000,000 dong) compared to the original answer (300,000 to 500,000 dong)."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer does not exactly match the original answer, it still captures the main idea and provides more detailed information about the regulations. The answer is relevant as it explains the purpose and policies of the Quy chế phối hợp quản lý các vùng đất ngập nước quan trọng, which is a key aspect of the original answer. Minor differences in wording and additional information provided do not detract from the overall relevance of the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it discusses the importance of using the mangrove area sustainably, which is in line with the responsibility mentioned in the original answer. Although the generated answer does not directly cite the original answer's mention of 'Quy chế phối hợp quản lý các vùng đất ngập nước quan trọng', it still conveys the same message and purpose."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant to the original answer because it mentions some of the activities that can be conducted on important wetland areas, such as khai thác thủy sản, nuôi trồng thủy sản, khai thác lâm sản, và các hoạt động khác. However, it does not mention the responsibility to conserve and sustainably use these areas, which is a crucial aspect of the original answer. Additionally, the generated answer omits important context about the regulations and laws that govern these activities."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information related to the conservation of important wetlands, such as laws and regulations. However, the answer exceeds the scope of the original answer by including regulations that are not specifically related to the conservation of important wetlands, such as the regulation on state secrets. Moreover, the provided laws and regulations are not clearly explained or applied to the context of important wetlands, and therefore do not demonstrate a clear understanding of the original answer's responsibilities and requirements."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it provides a range of fines for a specific behavior (đua xe đạp trên đường or racing bicycles on the road) which is related to the original answer. However, the range provided in the generated answer is different from the original answer, which indicates a mismatch in the specifics of the fine range."
NONE_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer because it's discussing a different topic. The original answer is about a specific fine range (200,000 - 300,000 VND), while the generated answer is about a hypothetical scenario ('đua xe đạp' or 'racing bicycles') and provides a conclusion that 'there is no decision on the fine' for such behavior. The topics are unrelated, making the generated answer non-relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant in that it addresses the topic of punishment for illegal activities on the road. However, it diverges from the original answer in terms of the specific range of fines provided. The original answer mentions a range of 200,000 - 300,000 VND, whereas the generated answer provides a different range of 80,000 - 100,000 VND. Additionally, the generated answer also mentions other types of violations, which is not present in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Though the generated answer is in the same format as the original answer (specific range of fine amounts), the fine amounts themselves are incorrect. The generated fine amounts (80.000-100.000 đồng) do not match the original fine amounts (200.000-300.000 đồng). The relevance is partly due to the similar format, but the numerical values are not accurate."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in that it mentions fines for riding a bike on the road, but the fine ranges and specific cases are different. The generated answer provides more detailed information on the specific cases and their corresponding fine ranges, whereas the original answer only mentions a single fine range. However, the context and topic of the generated answer are still relevant to the original question."
