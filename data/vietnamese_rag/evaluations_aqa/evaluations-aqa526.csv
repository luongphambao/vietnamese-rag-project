Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer provides additional information and examples, it addresses the main idea of the original answer, which is that not all violations of the law result in financial penalties.

However, it does not provide a direct quote or identical information as the original answer."

Therefore, while the generated answer shares some similarities with the original answer, it is not entirely relevant."

While it touches on the topic of dispute resolution, it fails to address the specific consequence mentioned in the original answer, making it only partly relevant."
