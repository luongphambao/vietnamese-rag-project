Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it accurately responds to the generated question and provides a clear explanation on the purpose of receiving remote sensing data in the buffer zone of infrastructure projects. The content of the generated answer is similar to the original answer in that it mentions the importance of receiving remote sensing data in the buffer zone during the land allocation, lease, and investment management process to ensure the stability and operation of infrastructure projects according to technical specifications and designs."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, except that it includes the rephrased question in the beginning. The content and context of the generated answer are very similar to the original answer, as it provides the same information about when the path for protecting infrastructure receives remote sensing images."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question. While it does not provide an exact match with the original answer, it acknowledges that the technical specifications are necessary for the project to operate stably. However, the generated answer goes beyond the scope of the original answer by providing additional information on the types of technical specifications (Bảng tổng hợp khối lượng công tác xây dựng, Hồ sơ đo bóc khối lượng xây dựng, etc.) and their importance. This additional information makes the generated answer partially relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a similar penalty range (from 2.000.000 to 3.000.000 đồng) for the same type of delayed assistance in storing national reserves, but the exact value threshold mentioned in the original answer is modified from below 100.000.000 đồng to below 100 triệu đồng (without the explicitly mentioned unit). This minor modification of the condition affects the relevance of the generated answer compared to the original answer, hence classified as PARTLY_RELEVANT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a direct quote from the original answer, repeating the exact same sentence from the original answer. The structure and content of the generated answer are highly similar to those of the original answer, indicating a high degree of relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by mentioning that the maximum fine for the delayed rescue of national reserve goods valued under 100 million dong is not mentioned in the text. However, it could have provided more specific information, including the actual fine amount, which is mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer also implies that the text only regulates fines for different value ranges, which is not entirely accurate according to the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a different fine range than the original answer. The original answer states that the fine is from 3.000.000 to 5.000.000 VND, while the generated answer states that the fine is from 1.000.000 to 2.000.000 VND. The generated answer also does not mention the condition that the value of the national reserve is less than 100.000.000 VND, which is present in the original answer. This suggests that the generated answer is not relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer by mentioning a regulatory body (Bộ Giao thông vận tải) related to the topic of storage emergency aid; however, it does not accurately reflect the original answer's specific content (phạt tiền từ 3.000.000 đồng đến 5.000.000 đồng đối với hành vi chậm trễ trong việc cứu trợ hàng dự trữ quốc gia)"
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a paraphrased version of the original answer, restating the condition for a civil servant to receive a monthly work-related allowance. The generated answer covers the same topic and provides the same essential information as the original answer, differing only in wording. The relevance and accuracy of the generated answer are high."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it still conveys the same information as the original answer, which is the duration of work is over 10 days/month to be eligible for work expense allowance. The generated answer also provides additional information about the specific regulations and allowances, but it still remains true to the original answer's purpose and meaning."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer by asking about a regulation (Thông tư) that governs the allowance of state officials. However, the generated answer is incomplete as it does not provide any details about the regulation or its contents, whereas the original answer provides specific information about the regulation and its scope. The generated answer mainly consists of a restatement of the question, which is not a relevant or substantial answer to the original question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer by providing some relevant information about the procedure for registration evaluation at the Securities Exchange Commission. However, it strays from the original context by focusing on 'thay đổi đăng ký giao dịch' (change registration) instead of 'đăng ký niêm yết' (listing). Additionally, the timeline and details mentioned in the generated answer do not exactly match those in the original answer."
