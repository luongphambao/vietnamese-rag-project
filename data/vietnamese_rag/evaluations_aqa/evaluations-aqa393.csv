Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question and repeats some information from the original answer. However, it does not provide a clear and concise summary of the relevant case (case 3), and the answer is more of an explanation rather than a direct answer to the question. A relevant answer would have directly answered the question with a specific case mentioned in the original answer, such as 'The case of free environmental protection for people in areas without clean water systems is case 3...'."
