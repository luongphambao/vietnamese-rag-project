Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar in structure and content to the original answer. It also provides the same information, which is a range of fine (from 6,000,000 dong to 8,000,000 dong). The only difference is that the original answer is provided in a sentence format, while the generated answer is in a paragraph format. Despite this difference, the generated answer conveys the same information as the original answer, making it relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely matches the original answer in terms of content and context. The generated answer provides a specific punishment amount range (6,000,000 - 8,000,000 VND) for the same scenario as mentioned in the question (someone sitting behind controling a motorcycle). The only difference is that the question asks for the financial penalty while the generated answer provides the punishment amount range."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is exactly the same as the original answer, with the same range of fines. The context of the generated question is about the fine for the act of someone sitting at the rear seat controlling the motorbike, which is still relevant to the original answer about a fine range. Although the question asks about a specific scenario, the answer still applies to the original question's domain."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer, which talks about a fine range of 6-8 million dong, whereas the generated answer provides a fine range of 200-300 thousand dong for a specific behavior (sitting behind and controlling a motorcycle). This shows a lack of relevance between the generated answer and the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer verbatim, indicating a high level of relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a verbatim copy of the original answer, without any alterations. It provides the exact same information about the penalty range (5,000,000 - 10,000,000 VND) for violating measures to ensure postal safety and security. The question and generated answer demonstrate a high degree of similarity, indicating strong relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer, as it mentions the same penalty range (5,000,000 to 10,000,000 VND) for the same reason (not providing sufficient measures to ensure safety and security in postal services). The generated answer slightly rephrases the original answer, making it a relevant response to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer, 'Mức phạt tối đa đối với việc cung cấp dịch vụ bưu chính thiếu an toàn, an ninh là 10.000.000 đồng đến 20.000.000 đồng', is relevant because it provides a similar range of fines as the original answer, 'Phạt tiền từ 5.000.000 đồng đến 10.000.000 đồng'. Although the range has been expanded to 10-20 million, the content is still related to the maximum fine for inadequate postal service security and safety, which is the focus of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content, as it mentions a specific range of fines. However, it does not fully match the original answer, as the generated answer only mentions the minimum fine, whereas the original answer provides a range of fines. The context of the generated question is related to the original answer, as it also deals with fines, but the specific requirement of the question (finding the minimum fine) was not fully met by the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, essentially reproducing the same content. The only difference is that the generated answer is a question-answer pair, whereas the original answer was a standalone text. The information covered in the generated answer is identical to the original answer, making it highly relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question and provides a specific answer that is identical to one of the points mentioned in the original answer. The original answer lists various contents related to the theoretical exam for train drivers, and one of those contents is the law that serves as the basis for the exam. The generated answer accurately extracts this information from the original answer and provides a concise response."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it directly addresses the question about the technical standards related to driving a train on a national railway. Although it does not perfectly match the original answer in terms of wording and detail, the main points and key information are correct and consistent with the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer selectively quotes from the original answer, extracting the relevant information about additional documents besides the Law on Railways that are applied to theoretical training for train operators. The generated answer does not fully replicate the original answer, but it conveys the same information and provides a similar structure. The similarity is sufficient to classify the generated answer as relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides specific details about the components checked during the theoretical examination of a locomotive driver, which is also mentioned in the original answer as part of the knowledge required."
