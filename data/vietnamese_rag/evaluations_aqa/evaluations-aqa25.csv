Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately answers the generated question and provides the same information as the original answer. Both the generated and original answers mention Toni Kroos' assist in Gareth Bale's first goal, which is the main piece of information asked for in the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, with minor differences in wording and sentence structure. The content and context are identical, with the same information and details being provided about Antonio Conte's negotiations with Chelsea regarding Eden Hazard's salary and role in the team."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the same figure (300.000 bảng/tuần) as the original answer, and it's directly related to the original sentence. Although the generated answer is a repetition of a specific detail, it is still directly relevant to the original context, and the information is accurate."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not mention anything about Chelsea building their playing style around Hazard, which is the main topic discussed in the original answer. The generated answer instead talks about Chelsea's plan to win a match against Man United and retain a safe distance from Tottenham, which is unrelated to the original context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches with the original answer. While it correctly mentions Antonio Conte's attempt to extend Courtois' contract, it omits the other player (Hazard) mentioned in the original answer and adds other players (Veratti and Aubameyang) not mentioned in the original answer. This suggests that the generated answer is partially related to the original answer but not fully accurate."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely based on the original answer, duplicating the list of essential skills required for success. Although the wording is slightly different, the content is remarkably similar, and the key concepts are preserved."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information, such as the importance of learning and acquiring skills, but it lacks the overall context and nuance of the original answer. The original answer emphasizes the need for individuals to consider their role in society, personal development, and relationships, whereas the generated answer focuses primarily on the individual's career and skills. While the generated answer provides some practical advice, it does not fully capture the broader perspective and themes present in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, as it identifies the importance of soft skills in finding one's place in life. The answer is relevant because it acknowledges the role of education in providing a foundation for personal and professional development, which is consistent with the original answer. The generated answer also mentions specific skills such as communication, financial management, and self-care, which are mentioned in the original answer. The only minor difference is the rephrasing of the answer to focus on finding a 'địa điểm' (place) in life, whereas the original answer frames it as finding a 'chỗ đứng' (standing) in life. However, the overall information and key concepts are preserved, making the generated answer relevant to the original."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the essence of the original answer, as it mentions the importance of life skills such as communication, personal finance management, and self-care in addition to academic success. However, it does not fully convey the idea that success is not just about personal achievements, but also about contributing to society. The generated answer provides a more simplistic and individualistic view of success compared to the original answer's emphasis on social contributions and finding one's place in life."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of describing Tăng Thanh Hà's postpartum body shape as 'thanh mảnh, gọn gàng' (slim and slender). However, the generated answer adds an extra phrase 'con gái' (girl) which is not present in the original answer, and the verb 'thể' (get back) is replaced with 'đã lấy lại' (already taken back). These changes affect the relevance of the generated answer compared to the original one."
