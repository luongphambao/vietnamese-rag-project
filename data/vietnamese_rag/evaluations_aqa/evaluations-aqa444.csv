Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer because it mentions the same fine range (100,000 VND to 300,000 VND). However, the context and question are different. The original answer provides a general statement about a fine, while the generated answer is in response to a specific question about punishment for compelling a child to divorce, which makes the generated answer partially relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of providing punishment levels (phạt tiền) and a specific law (Luật phòng, chống bạo lực gia đình năm 2014) that is relevant to the context. However, the generated answer is not entirely relevant as it provides additional information about specific scenarios (ép buộc con ra khỏi chỗ ở hợp pháp) that are not present in the original answer. The language and context are also different, making it not entirely relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant in that it addresses a related scenario (cha mẹ ép buộc con gái ly hôn) and provides a justification for why the scenario is not applicable. However, the original answer specifies a range of fines (Phạt tiền từ 100.000 đồng đến 300.000 đồng), which is not mentioned or addressed in the generated answer. The generated answer focuses on the legal context and the possibilities of inheritance, whereas the original answer appears to be a concise statement of a specific fine."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, as it also mentions the range of fines for causing an accident while not providing aid to the injured party. The only difference is the use of 'lái xe máy' instead of 'chạy xe máy', which is a minor variation and does not affect the overall relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, matching the exact same content and specific figures (6,000,000 dong to 8,000,000 dong). The only difference is the format, with the original answer being a statement and the generated answer being a paraphrased version. The information is accurate and relevant to the original question, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic and matching the original answer with high similarity."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer. The only difference is in the wording, with the generated answer being more concise and directly addressing the question. The key information, such as the fine range and the circumstances (Tai nạn giao thông and không tham gia cấp cứu người bị nạn), is identical in both answers. This suggests that the generated answer is directly derived from the original answer, making it highly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it contains the same information as the original answer, which is the fine range for running a motorcycle causing a traffic accident and not participating in emergency aid to the injured person. However, the generated answer is in the form of a question and does not provide the actual answer to the question, unlike the original answer that provides the fine range."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides the same information about the fine and penalty for causing an accident while driving a motorbike and not helping the injured person. The generated answer is a rephrased version of the original answer, but it still conveys the same key information, making it relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the minimum space requirement for practicing a sport, which is related to the original answer's focus on ensuring a minimum of 10m2/person for training. However, the generated answer also introduces an additional aspect by mentioning that there is no legal limit to the minimum space requirement, which diverges from the original answer's specific numerical value. As a result, the generated answer is partly relevant, but not directly addressing the original answer's specific point."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, as it mirrors the same content and structure. The only difference is that the generated answer is framed as a statement, while the original answer is part of a sentence. The information provided in the generated answer is identical to the original, and it directly answers the generated question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the exact same information as the original answer, discussing the minimum required space area for each person when practicing volleyball. The keywords 'diện tích dành cho mỗi người' in the question and 'ít nhất 10m2/1 người' in the answer match precisely, indicating significant relevance and similarity with the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer by discussing the importance of keeping a safe distance between individuals during exercise, as mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer fails to directly address the original topic of ensuring at least 10m2/person, instead discussing the lack of a specific minimum distance requirement in law and the need for a safe distance in educational settings."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is only partially relevant to the original answer. While it mentions that there is no specific guideline for the area per person, it does not provide the exact information required, which is the minimum area per person (10m2/1 person) mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer provides additional context about the variable area requirements for different sports, but this is not directly related to the core information in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it discusses the age limit for recruitment into the military, which is in line with the original answer. However, the generated answer mistakenly states that the person is not allowed to join the military because they are not old enough, whereas the original answer explicitly states that people born in 2000 (ages 21-22) are allowed to participate in the recruitment process."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer by mentioning the age restriction for military recruitment, but it does not provide the exact information about the recruitment age range (21-22) mentioned in the original answer. Additionally, the generated answer provides more detailed conditions for recruitment, whereas the original answer is a straightforward statement of eligibility."
