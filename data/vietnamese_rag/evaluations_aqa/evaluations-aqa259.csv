Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer mirrors the original answer in terms of content, including the specific model names (iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus), sales figures, and market share percentages. The answer does not repeat any identical phrases from the original text, but preserves the essential information. The only minor difference is the use of a more concise phrase to describe the sales figures ('Tần suất bán ra') instead of the original wording ('đạt được doanh số bán hàng'). Overall, the generated answer meets the expectation of conveying the same information as the original answer in a rewritten form."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately provides the sales figures of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in the second quarter of 2017, which is the main point of the original answer.
