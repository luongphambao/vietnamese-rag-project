Although the specific information provided in the generated answer is different from the original answer, the context and topic are related, and the generated answer does provide relevant information about the relationship between the testing materials, which is similar to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant as it provides some information about the decision allowing the transformation of the social foundation to a social enterprise, similar to the original answer. However, it lacks context and clarity, and the format is different from the original answer. The original answer provides a much more comprehensive explanation of the process and responsibilities, whereas the generated answer is more concise and focused on a specific aspect."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it accurately describes the transfer of assets and rights by a social organization to a social enterprise after registering. The generated answer includes essential information such as the transfer of all rights and legal interests, responsibility for debts, and the cessation of the social organization's activities, which is consistent with the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly similar to the original answer, as it states that the social enterprise inherits the responsibilities of the social support foundation. The generated answer also mentions the specific responsibilities inherited, such as taking over debts, including tax debts, labor contracts, and other obligations, which matches the original answer. The difference lies in the lack of the specific details mentioned in the original answer, such as the registration process and the cessation of the social support foundation's activities."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not directly answer the generated question 'When does the operation of the social support foundation cease?' Instead, it provides information about the process of registering a social enterprise, including the transfer of assets and responsibilities, which is not related to the cessation of the social support foundation's operation. The provided answer seems to mix up the information about the registration process and the cessation of operation."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not related to the registration of a social enterprise as mentioned in the original answer. Instead, it provides information about the competent authorities responsible for granting licenses to social enterprises, which is a slightly related but distinct aspect."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a range of fines for a specific type of offense, which is partially relevant to the original answer. However, the range of fines mentioned in the generated answer (40,000,000 - 60,000,000 VND) is different from the range provided in the original answer (25,000,000 - 32,000,000 VND). The generated answer also proposes a different range of fines for a specific type of offense, which is not matched with the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it provides the same fine range for the fine imposed (25.000.000 đồng to 32.000.000 đồng) in response to a question about the fine for a specific offense, which is lấn chiếm rừng dari 5000m2 to dưới 7000m2. The answer does not contain any extraneous or irrelevant information, making it a direct and accurate response to the question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the context of the original answer, as both mention fines for activities related to forest encroachment. However, the specific fine ranges mentioned do not align (25.000.000 - 32.000.000 vs. 3.000.000 - 7.000.000). The generated answer is not entirely irrelevant, but it only partly addresses the original answer's scope and accuracy."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it provides a specific range of fine amounts for the illegal occupation of special-use forests with a size between 5000m2 and 7000m2, which is a topic closely related to the original answer. Although the range of fine amounts is different (3,000,000 - 7,000,000 vs 25,000,000 - 32,000,000), the focus on the specific scenario and the scale of the illegal occupation are consistent with the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relevant to the original answer. Although the generated answer does not provide a specific fine amount, it mentions that the fine is not specifically regulated for the situation described in the question (lân chiếm rừng đặc dụng có diện tích từ 5000m2 đến dưới 7000m2). This information is somewhat related to the original answer which mentions a fine range of 25.000.000 đồng to 32.000.000 đồng. However, the generated answer does not provide a direct answer to the question about the fine amount, instead it explains that it is not specifically regulated, which is not the same information as the original answer. Hence, the relevance is PARTLY_RELEVANT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of the responsibilities of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in conserving genetic resources of livestock, including setting regulations, organizing and supervising conservation activities. It also mentions the annual planning and research activities related to conservation, which is consistent with the original answers. The only difference is that the generated answer provides more specific details and elaborates on the responsibilities. Overall, the relevance and similarity to the original answer are high."
