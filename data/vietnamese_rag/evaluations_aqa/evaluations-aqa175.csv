Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer to a certain extent as it mentions the same topic about the education of children in preschools. However, the content is not fully equivalent, as the original answer provides specific numbers (35% and 90%) and context about the target age groups, which is not present in the generated answer. The generated answer merely repeats the same sentence as the question, lacking the additional information provided in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer in terms of content and context. The generated answer correctly states that the target groups for increasing Vietnamese skills until 2020 are children from ethnic minority groups in kindergarten and preschool ages, with a focus on ensuring 100% of children in preschool education institutions receive targeted Vietnamese language training suitable for their age. The generated answer not only maintains the same structure and organization as the original answer but also includes specific and relevant details, demonstrating strong relevance to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely relevant as it correctly identifies the two types of engines used in the Honda CR-V 2017: the turbocharged 1.5L engine and the non-turbocharged 2.0L engine. The answer also provides the same level of detail and specificity as the original answer, including the power and torque output for each engine. The only minor difference is the rephrasing of the original sentence structure, but the content remains largely unchanged, making it a relevant answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately extracts the required information from the original text, specifically the type of engine with a power output of 190 horsepower on the Honda CR-V 2017. The answer is concise and relevant to the original question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it mentions the correct information about the base model's engine specifications (2.0 lít). However, it does not provide the remaining relevant information about the engine's power and torque output, and also rephrases the question as a statement, which makes it less similar to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly answers the question about the horsepower and torque of the 2.0l engine on Honda CR-V 2017, which is also mentioned in the original answer. The answer is correct and provides the same information as the original answer, making it relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it correctly states that Honda CR-V 2017 uses the Earth Dreams CVT transmission. However, the answer only provides partial information as it does not include details about the engines and their respective outputs, which are an important part of the original answer. The generated answer also provides some additional information about the transmission's replacement of the older 5-speed automatic transmission, which is not mentioned in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it provides the exact same information, including the number of people detained in the UK (16) and their current status. The answer is verbatim from the original answer, only with a rephrased statement at the beginning. The context of the generated question is closely matched with the content of the generated answer, making it a relevant response."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides two specific names (Lê Văn Thọ and Nguyễn Văn Tình) and claims that they are still under detention, whereas the original answer only mentions that 14 people are still being held to serve the investigation. The additional details in the generated answer are not supported by the original answer, and the information about the two individuals is not related to the original context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is referring to the same event ( vụ đánh bom ở Manchester) and provides similar information about the number of people arrested (16) and their current status (2 freed, 14 still detained). However, it does not directly answer the question asked (about people related to the bombing incident), so it is only partly relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately extracts and reformulates the information from the original answer, stating the exact number of individuals released (2) and directly answering the generated question, making it highly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately rephrases the original answer, providing the same information about Jon Venables and Robert Thompson being the perpetrators of the James Bulger murder. The only difference is the minor phrasing variation, which does not affect the core meaning or relevance of the answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately provides the date of the James Bulger case, which is mentioned in the original answer. However, the original answer provides additional context about the suspects, which is missing in the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it provides the same information as the original answer, stating that Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were around 10-12 years old when they committed the crime. The answer is identical in its content and has the same context as the original answer. The only difference is the repetition of the question, which is not relevant to the evaluation of the answer's relevance."
