Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is off-topic and irrelevant to the original answer. The original answer is discussing the assessment of the impact of climate change on economic-social activities and inter-sectoral, inter-regional, and interdisciplinary issues, while the generated answer provides a list of unrelated fields such as agricultural programs, investment projects, and laws related to state secrets, employee management, and retired officers."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is related to the original answer as it mentions the assessment of climate change's impact on economic-social activities. However, it is only a small part of the original answer, which provides a broader framework for assessment. The generated answer is focused on a specific point, whereas the original answer provides a more comprehensive outline."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the essence of the original answer, as it mentions the positive and negative impacts of climate change on the economy and society. However, the generated answer is missing some critical details, such as the specific areas of the economy and society that are affected, and the long-term consequences of climate change. Additionally, the generated answer lacks the nuanced evaluation of the impacts, as seen in the original answer, which discusses both the positive and negative effects in detail. Despite these limitations, the generated answer provides a general overview of the impacts of climate change, making it partly relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially focuses on the time limit mentioned in the original text, which is the key information sought in the context of 'tham vấn ý kiến'. However, it deviates from the original context by mentioning 'quyết định' instead of 'yêu cầu của Ủy ban Cạnh tranh Quốc gia về việc tham vấn ý kiến'. This slight mismatch in language and context reduces the relevance of the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately identifies the legal basis for the National Competition Committee's request for opinions, which aligns with the original answer's statement about the Committee's authority to solicit opinions. The generated answer also correctly mentions the specific content being discussed (thỏa thuận hạn chế cạnh tranh bị cấm đang được đề nghị hưởng miễn trừ). However, the generated answer does not exactly replicate the original answer's phrasing and structure."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely paraphrases the original answer, rephrasing the original text while preserving the same information and structure. Although the wording is slightly different, the generated answer accurately conveys the same information as the original answer, including the specific conditions and requirements for the agencies, organizations, and individuals involved."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately identifies the competent authority that approves the plan to select a contractor providing medicinal products, which is a key piece of information in the original answer. The generated answer is focused on a specific aspect (phê duyệt) which is also present in the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer mentions 'đơn vị' (unit) and 'review' (review qua), the content is unrelated to the original answer, which talks about the responsibility of the local health department (Sở Y tế) in reviewing the plan submitted by a purchasing unit. The generated answer discusses a totally different topic, the development of a plan for nuclear energy regulation, and the responsibilities of different ministries and provincial governments in reviewing it."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original question, providing information about the submission process of the plan for selecting a drug supplier. However, it also adds some additional details that are not present in the original answer, such as the detailed process of the review and approval of the plan. The answer still conveys the main idea of where the plan should be submitted, but deviates slightly from the original answer's tone and scope."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question 'What is the authority entrusted with appraising the procurement plans?' by mentioning the competent authorities responsible for receiving and appraising procurement plans. However, it focuses on the specific regulations and departments involved, whereas the original answer specifically states that the local Health Department (Sở Y tế) is responsible for evaluating the procurement plans. The relevance is limited due to the generation of unrelated details and lack of specificity."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is irrelevant to the original answer, which mentions a monetary range (5,000,000 to 10,000,000 VND), while the generated answer discusses the reporting schedule of the Vietnamese Notary Association. There is no connection or overlap between the two answers."
