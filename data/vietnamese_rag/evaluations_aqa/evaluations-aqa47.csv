RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely mirrors the original answer in terms of content and context. Both answers emphasize the importance of cooking with passion and putting love into the process of preparing food. The generated answer also includes similar phrases and ideas, such as 'nấu ăn bằng cả trái tim' and 'mang đến món ăn đảm bảo dinh dưỡng và ngon miệng cho thực khách', which are also present in the original answer. Overall, the generated answer effectively conveys the same message as the original answer and is considered relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it contains the same main idea and information. The original answer mentions that North Korea uses strange numbers to transmit information to spies operating in South Korea, and the generated answer also mentions using strange numbers to transmit information to spies operating in South Korea. The only difference is the question being asked, but the answer is entirely consistent with the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer covers some of the same topics as the original answer, specifically mentioning the use of coded messages and the possibility of them being orders for spies. However, it does not accurately convey the nuance of the original answer, which mentions 'hành động tung hỏa mù' (a move to create tension) as an opposing theory. The generated answer also omits the mention of some houses of analysts having a different opinion, which is a crucial part of the original text."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not entirely relevant to the original answer, as it only mentions a specific aspect of the incident, which is the possible use of strange numbers to transmit messages to North Korean spies in South Korea. The original answer mentions both the possibility of using strange numbers for espionage and the counter-theory that it's a smoke bomb to create tension in South Korea. The generated answer doesn't consider the alternative theory, making it partly relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it provides the same explanation for why the AIM-9X missile was unable to destroy the Su-22 aircraft in the first engagement. The generated answer contains the same key points as the original answer, including the fact that the Su-22's heat decoy led to the failure of the AIM-9X and the subsequent need for the pilot to launch a more advanced missile, AIM-120C AMRAAM. The generated answer is essentially a copy of the original answer, with no significant differences in content or context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer because it mentions the Su-22 Syria's evasive measures, specifically the decoy heat signature, which is also mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer lacks the key information about the AIM-9X missile being unable to hit the Su-22 in the first shot, and instead focuses on the context of the F/A-18E launching the AIM-9X. This portion of the answer is not present in the original answer and is therefore not entirely relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides relevant information about the AIM-120C AMRAAM missile, including its characteristics and differences with the AIM-9X. Although it does not perfectly match the original text, it provides accurate and relevant details about the missile, which is in line with the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the reason why the pilot had to use AIM-120C AMRAAM, which is the same reason mentioned in the original answer, i.e., the AIM-9X being decoyed by the Su-22's heat signature. The generated answer is a concise and relevant paraphrase of the original answer, providing a clear explanation for the pilot's decision to switch to AIM-120C AMRAAM."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer by mentioning that the Su-22 Syria was 'lạc hậu' (outdated) and that it was defeated by the AIM-9X missile after being fooled by the heat trap. However, the generated answer provides a simplified and incorrect account of the events, omitting the detail about the AIM-120C AMRAAM missile being used and not providing the correct context about the 'lạc hậu' designation. The similarity between the generated answer and the original answer is partial, but the content is not a direct copy or equivalent to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a partial answer to the generated question, extracting a specific detail (Phó Giáo sư Văn Như Cương là người Nghệ An ra Hà Nội lập nghiệp) from the original text. Although it does not answer the entire question, it is still relevant and aligns with the core information of the original text."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly relevant to the original answer as it mentions the significant contributions of Phó Giáo sư Văn Như Cương to education and his wish to build a school for underprivileged children. However, the generated answer is not entirely relevant as it lacks details about his career and experiences as the original answer provides, and it does not mention his establishment of a school in Hà Nội, which is mentioned in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately states the name of the school (Mầm non Na Ngao) that Phó Giáo sư Văn Như Cương had a strong desire to build for underprivileged children in Hà Giang, which is a crucial fact mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information about Phó Giáo sư Văn Như Cương's contributions to education and his character, which is mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer fails to directly answer the question about when he started to have the idea of building a school for disadvantaged children. Instead, it only mentions that the idea was born in 2014, which is a key detail from the original answer, but not the main focus of the generated answer. The generated answer also omits other important context about the school and the fund."
