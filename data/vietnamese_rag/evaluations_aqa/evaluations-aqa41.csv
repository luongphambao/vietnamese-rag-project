Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a verbatim repetition of the original answer, providing the same information about the topic of the event and its conclusion. The answer is therefore highly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, which answers the generated question accurately and provides the exact location of Bãi biển Ashleam."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original one, as it mentions the same reason (bão) for the disappearance of Bãi biển Ashleam. However, the generated answer lacks context and mentions only one event (2005) whereas the original answer provides more comprehensive information about the beach's disappearance and reappearance due to recent weather events and its history of being washed away."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately provides the period of time after which Bãi biển Ashleam reappeared, which is also present in the original answer. The generated answer is a concise summary of the original answer, making it relevant to the generated question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the reason for Bãi biển Ashleam's reappearance, which is the recent unusual weather event. This is partially relevant to the original answer, as it correctly identifies the weather event as the cause of the beach's reappearance. However, it is missing the additional detail about the storm in 2005 that also played a role in the beach's disappearance. As a result, the generated answer is only partially relevant to the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'Không có thông tin về Hạt Mayo trong ngữ cảnh này.' is not relevant to the original answer which provides information about Bãi biển Ashleam on Achill Island, Mayo, Ireland. The generated answer is a statement indicating that there is no information about Mayo, which is unrelated to the original answer's content and context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer includes similar information and key points as the original answer, such as the description of Mosul as a 'vùng đất ma' (city of the dead), the state of destruction of buildings, and the presence of rubble. However, it lacks some details and specific examples mentioned in the original answer, such as the destruction of the Somod district and the Al-Hadba tower. Overall, the generated answer captures the essence of the original answer, but with some omissions and minor rephrasing."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a relevant description of the damaged infrastructure in Mosul, including the Nouriyya Academy, the Al-Hadba Tower, the Museum, and civilian homes. While the original answer provides a more detailed and descriptive account, the generated answer accurately captures the essence of the damage and destruction in Mosul."

While the generated answer is brief and does not cover all the aspects of destruction mentioned in the original answer, it does provide a relevant and specific piece of information that is related to the original text."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer mentions the university and a residential area, it only partially covers the scope of the original answer, which describes multiple locations in Mosul, including hospitals, museums, and streets. Additionally, the generated answer focuses specifically on the extent of the damage (being 'thiêu cháy' which translates to being burned) whereas the original answer provides a broader description of the destruction and devastation."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it provides the correct information about the total number of children of Chang and Eng. However, it is not fully relevant because the generated question specifically asked for the answer in the context of 'hai anh em sinh đôi', which is not present in the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially answers the original question, providing the correct number of Chang's children (10). However, it does not address the part about Eng's children, which is mentioned in the original answer. This partial relevance makes it PARTLY_RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer only partially relates to the original answer because it correctly states that the provided text does not have information about the number of daughters of Eng.

(How many children each of Chang and Eng's siblings have?) The generated answer provides the same information as the original answer, which makes it highly relevant to the question."
