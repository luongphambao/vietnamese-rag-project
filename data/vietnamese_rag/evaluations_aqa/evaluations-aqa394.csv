Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content. The generated answer addresses the query 'Khi nào cơ quan thực hiện pháp điển bổ sung kết quả pháp điển và gửi hồ sơ bổ sung đến Bộ Tư pháp?' which is a specific detail presented in the original answer. The original answer mentions that in case of new documents published after sending the result and before the Council's conclusion, the agency may supplement the result and send a supplemental dossier to the Ministry of Justice. The generated answer provides a more specific time constraint for supplementing the dossier, which is also mentioned in the original answer. Overall, the generated answer is relevant to the original answer, although it only captures a part of the information presented."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the same scenario as the original answer, but provides a different solution. The original answer mentions the need to supplement the result and send it to the Ministry of Justice, whereas the generated answer suggests submitting the new document and suspending the sending of the result. Although the context is similar, the answers are not identical, making it PARTLY_RELEVANT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer captures the main point of the original answer, which is ensuring gender equality in STEM education. Although the wording and sentence structure are different, the content is very similar. The generated answer also includes relevant examples and details such as equal access to education, equal application of science and technology, and promoting research results, which are all present in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially rephrases the original answer, maintaining the core message and reiterating the key points. While the structure and wording are slightly different, the content remains largely faithful to the original. The generated answer also adds some minor details, such as 'được tham gia đào tạo và nghiên cứu khoa học, được phổ biến kết quả nghiên cứu để phát triển và ứng dụng vào thực tế', but these do not significantly alter the overall relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially reuses the original sentence and provides additional information, but it focuses on specific regulations and restrictions rather than the overall principle of equal access for men and women in science and technology. The generated answer does not fully capture the essence of the original answer, which emphasizes the importance of ensuring equal access and opportunities, but it still contains related information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is the same as the original answer, demonstrating exact matching and relevance, thus ranking 'RELEVANT' in relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is directly addressing the reason why hình thức kỷ luật Đảng cannot be used instead of hình thức kỷ luật hành chính, which is in line with the original answer. The answer is a paraphrased version of the original answer, providing a clear explanation."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially discusses ways to handle internal regulations (nội quy Đảng) through transparency, accountability, and lawfulness, which is related to the concept of 'đánh giá xét xử lý kỷ luật' (evaluation and examination of discipline handling) in the original answer. However, it does not explicitly state that it involves replacing administrative punishment with party discipline as in the original answer, making it only partly relevant to the original content."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer by describing the differences between Đảng's discipline and administrative discipline. However, it does not directly answer the original question, which states that 'Não, không áp dụng hình thức kỷ luật Đảng thay cho hình thức kỷ luật hành chính.' (No, Party discipline cannot be applied in place of administrative discipline.) Instead, the generated answer focuses on the differences between the two disciplines, which is related but not directly answering the original question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between administrative discipline and party discipline. The generated answer explains that an individual can be disciplined multiple times with different forms of discipline, but only once with a specific form of discipline. It also highlights that if an individual continues to violate the rules while serving a disciplinary decision, they will be subject to harsher discipline. This explanation is closely related to the original answer, which states that party discipline cannot replace administrative discipline. The generated answer provides additional context and information, making it relevant to the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a question, not an answer. It also mentions 'Không có tài liệu về kinh phí tạm ứng' which is not present in the original answer. The original answer provides a detailed explanation of the payment schedule, whereas the generated answer is an irrelevant question."
