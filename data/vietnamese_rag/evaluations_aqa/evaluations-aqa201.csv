Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately repeats the year of birth mentioned in the original answer, which is 1964. It successfully retrieves the required information and provides a correct response."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer, as it maintains the same information about the person being injured, providing a correct and complementary response to the generated question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides accurate information about Sergey Kislyak's 10-year work at the Russian embassy in Washington D.C., which matches the context of the original answer. The minor difference in wording between 'nước Mỹ' (Vietnamese for 'the United States') and 'Washington D.C.' in the original answer does not affect the overall relevance of the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides specific information about Kislyak's departure from Washington D.C. However, it does not match the original answer's context about Kislyak returning to his country after 10 years of work. The generated answer only provides a specific year (2017) without mentioning the details about his return to country, which is the main focus of the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer because it simply repeats the question instead of providing a specific answer. The original answer mentions that Vladimir Voronkov was considered for the leadership position, not Nga. The generated answer fails to capture this context and provides a vague statement."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar and relevant to the original answer. Both answers discuss the same incident, including the cause and circumstances, and provide the same detailed information. The only difference is the exact wording, but the content and context are identical. The generated answer accurately captures the main events and key points from the original answer, making it highly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the main reason for the accident, which is the 3-year-old children eating the powdered plumber unclogger, caused by the faucet being clogged and the teacher's negligence. It also mentions the teacher storing the powdered plumber unclogger in a cabinet, which led to the children finding and eating it. The minor addition about the children having to be hospitalized is not crucial to understanding the main event. Overall, the generated answer is PARTLY_RELEVANT as it gets the main points and events right, but lacks some details and context compared to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the query, providing accurate information about the bags of powder not being stored in the classroom. However, it does not provide a complete answer as it only focuses on the bags being stored in the classroom and does not mention the actual cause of the accident (the kids eating the powder). The generated answer is also missing the crucial details about the kids' hospitalization."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content and context. It still revolves around the incident and the role of the teacher and administration in preventing similar accidents in the future. However, the tone and structure of the generated answer are quite different from the original, making it less relevant. The generated answer also seems to mimic the original's structure and phrasing, which also affects its relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the actions taken by the teacher after receiving the 2 packages of powder, which is similar to the original answer. The only difference is the additional information about the students opening the cupboard and eating the powder. The generated answer still maintains the core details and sequence of events described in the original answer, making it relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it also suggests that eating eggs and drinking tea after meals is not good for one's health. The answer provides a specific reason for this, which is the interaction between tannic acid in tea and protein in eggs slowing down the movement of the gut and leading to constipation and other negative effects. Although the original answer is more comprehensive, covering a broader range of food combinations, the generated answer is still relevant as it addresses a specific concern mentioned in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is strongly relevant to the original answer because it addresses the same topic (what to eat/drink after eating eggs) and provides specific advice against eating holly berry (hồng) after eating eggs, which is also mentioned in the original answer."
