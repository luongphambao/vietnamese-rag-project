Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, as it correctly states that the Bulava missile is deployed on a Borei-class submarine. The only minor difference is the omission of the specific number of launch tubes (16) mentioned in the original answer. Otherwise, the generated answer accurately conveys the same information about the rocket's deployment"
