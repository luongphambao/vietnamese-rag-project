Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by providing reasons why children being abused may be afraid of physical contact. However, it fails to specifically address the question's focus on the fear of being touched by someone else, instead providing a broader explanation of the child's fearful behavior. The original answer did mention the fear of being touched, but the generated answer does not directly address this point."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the relevant information about the behavioral differences in abused children compared to normal children. However, it omits the initial mention of physical signs of abuse and only focuses on behavioral differences. Although it mentions some of the behavioral signs, such as being overly passive, speaking quietly, or being overly aggressive, it does not cover the full range of behaviors mentioned in the original answer. Additionally, the generated answer does not acknowledge the fear and anxiety exhibited by abused children, which is a crucial aspect of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions Huân chương Chiến thắng hạng 3, which is a correct detail provided in the original answer. However, the generated answer is selective and doesn't provide the full context about Ông Nguyễn Văn Hồng's recognition status, which is a critical aspect of the original answer. The generated answer is relevant but incomplete, hence PARTLY_RELEVANT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer in terms of content and context. It correctly states the reasons why Ông Nguyễn Văn Hồng has not been recognized as a martyr, including the lack of recognition by the province of Thái Bình and the fact that the Certificate of Glory awarded to him has not been returned to his family. The generated answer also includes supplementary information about the specific events that led to this situation (e.g. the retrieval of the Certificate by the Bạch Đằng commune staff in 1960). While there are some minor differences in wording and minor omissions, the overall relevance and accuracy of the generated answer are high."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the year 1954, which is correct in terms of the date when Bằng Tổ quốc ghi công was awarded to Ông Nguyễn Văn Hồng. However, the question asked about the year when his family lost the award, which is related to a later event (1960). The generated answer doesn't fully respond to the original question, hence PARTLY_RELEVANT."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'Ông Nguyễn Văn Hồng đã hy sinh năm 1954' is relevant to the original answer as it provides a specific detail about the year of Ông Nguyễn Văn Hồng's death, which is mentioned in the original sentence ' Tuy nhiên, từ ngày ông hy sinh đến nay, tỉnh Thái Bình vẫn chưa công nhận ông là liệt sỹ.'"
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not provide any relevant information or answer the question asked. The answer is a simple question repeated, which is not a response to the original answer provided. The original answer states the source of the popular sushi rolls, while the generated answer does not provide any information or clarify the origin of the popular sushi rolls."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer as it mentions Canada as the origin of popular sushi rolls. However, the generated question and answer only provide information about where sushi rolls originate from, whereas the original answer mentions that popular sushi rolls people love actually come from Canada, which is a more specific and nuanced statement."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer's context, mentioning Canada as the origin of modern sushi. However, the generated answer lacks the key information about the specific types of sushi that are originally from Canada. The generated answer also contains an extra phrase ('egers.') that appears to be irrelevant to the topic."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the content of the original answer, correctly quoting the initial billing error ($284 trillion USD) and the corrected amount ($284.46 USD). However, it fails to provide a concise and clear summary of the situation, instead rephrasing the question and including an unnecessary sentence ('after conducting an inspection and fixing the system error'). The context and relevance are partially maintained, but the generated answer could be improved to better summarize the core information."
 части_relevant,"The generated answer partially repeats the same information from the original answer, mentioning the error with the electricity bill and the correction after re-examination. However, it lacks the detail on the correct bill amount (284,46 USD) mentioned in the original answer, making it only partially relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the same information about the corrected electricity bill amount for Mrs. Mary Horomanski's family."
