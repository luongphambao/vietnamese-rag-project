RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it identifies the same company (Công ty TNHH đá Granite Đông Phát) and same location (số 290 Lê Văn Hiến) as the original answer. The generated answer also provides a specific reason (vi phạm quỹ đất dành cho người đi bộ) that is directly related to the original answer. However, the format of the generated answer is in a different structure and the wording is not identical, which may account for the slight difference in relevance."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer lacks relevance to the original answer. The generated question seems to ask for a new suggestion for the Prime Minister of Pakistan, whereas the original answer provides the actual decision of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) on selecting Shahbaz Sharif as the new Prime Minister. The generated answer appears to be an incomplete or irrelevant response to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is correct and provides the same information as the original answer, which is the position held by Shahbaz Sharif before being nominated as the Prime Minister of Pakistan."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'Liên minh hồi giáo Pakistan cầm quyền (PML-N)' is partially relevant because it correctly identifies the party that nominated Shahbaz Sharif as the prime minister candidate. However, it lacks a crucial piece of information, which is the exact committee that made the decision, as specified in the original answer. The generated answer also repeated the question instead of providing a direct answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately states that Shahbaz Sharif is a member of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) party, which is a crucial detail mentioned in the original answer. The only difference is that the original answer mentions he is being nominated as the next Prime Minister, while the generated answer focuses solely on his party affiliation. Despite this, the generated answer is still relevant as it addresses the same party-related information."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original text, but it only provides a specific question's answer ( Gia đình cô gái đã chấp nhận mối quan hệ của chồng bạn) whereas the original answer is a longer narrative providing context about the girlfriend's family and their acceptance of the relationship. The generated answer lacks the important details and context, making it partly relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains a similar narrative structure and specific details from the original answer, including the description of the boyfriend's past relationship, the reasons for the girl's family not supporting their relationship, and the girl's decision to become a single mother.

Only minor details are missing, and the overall relevance is high."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it acknowledges the existence of a previous relationship between the husband and another woman, which matches part of the original answer. However, the generated answer is incomplete and misleadingly implies that the husband promised to marry the other woman, which is not supported by the original answer. The original answer provides more accurate and detailed context about the husband's previous relationship, which is not present in the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately mentions the sale price of Doom game, which is the same information mentioned in the original answer.
