Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer. The correct procedure for the tourism company is to negotiate with the international travel agency, not with foreign nationals. However, the generated answer correctly mentions that the tourism company needs to submit the certification documents at the Immigration Administration. The contextual relevance is partly preserved, but the target entity of the agreement has been misplaced."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by providing a related rule from the regulatory context. However, it lacks the most critical information, which is the existence of a regulation (Ðề đốc) and its specific implications. The original answer provides a clear and detailed explanation of the regulation, whereas the generated answer only mentions the rule without elaborating on its significance or application."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly matches the original answer in terms of content and context, providing the same fine range of punishment (5,000,000 - 10,000,000 VND) for the same illegal behavior. The only difference is the repetition of the question in the answer, which is a minor variation."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partly responds to the original answer, but not directly. The original answer provides a specific range of fines (5.000.000 to 10.000.000 dong), while the generated answer explains that there is no specific fine minimum for illegal business in the forest. Although they are related to fines, the generated answer provides an explanation rather than a direct answer that matches the original one."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of the range of the fine, but the condition is different. The original answer mentions a fine from 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 dong for an unspecified reason, whereas the generated answer specifies that the fine is for organizing a business service in the forest without permission, with a higher range of 10,000,000 to 25,000,000 dong."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer as it mentions the possibility of being fined for doing business in the forest without permission, which is related to the original answer's mention of being fined for doing business in the forest. However, the fine range in the generated answer ($40,000,000 - $60,000,000) is not consistent with the original answer's fine range ($5,000,000 - $10,000,000), which lowers the relevance score."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer. Both answers mention fines for violating laws, but the generated answer only provides a limited range of 1-5 million VND, which is a subset of the original answer's range of 5-10 million VND. The generated answer also provides additional information about the specific circumstances (transferring the purpose of special-use forests under 400m2) that contribute to the fine. However, the relevance is not entirely satisfactory due to the significant difference in the scope of the fine ranges."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not directly relevant to the original answer, as it provides a list of specific penalties for various traffic violations instead of the general penalty range mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer does provide some related information, including the fact that the penalties mentioned are within the context of traffic law, which is related to the theme of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it provides a specific scenario where the offense of blocking traffic by lying or sitting on the road occurs, which is then penalized with a fine from 100,000 to 200,000 VND. The generated answer closely replicates the original answer, although it is expressed in a different sentence structure."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, apart from being slightly more detailed. The generated question is also related to the content of the original answer, but is not directly quoted. This suggests that the RAG system has successfully retrieved and generated relevant information, with some potential enhancement of the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly quotes the original answer, providing the same information about the fine range for gathering a lot of people on the road. The question and answer are well-matched, making the generated answer highly relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information, mentioning that there is no direct answer to the specific question within the provided context. However, it also attempts to provide some general information about penalties related to public order and security, which is somewhat relevant to the original answer. The original answer specifically states the penalty range (100,000 - 200,000 VND), whereas the generated answer does not provide a specific number. Overall, the generated answer is partly relevant as it tries to provide some context and information related to the topic, but does not directly answer the original question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct response to the generated question and provides the same information as the original answer. The language used is similar, and the structure of the answer is the same. The answer includes both bullet points (a) and (b) from the original answer, which indicates that the model has accurately retrieved and generated the relevant information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the relevant information, as it correctly states that those authorized to manage a food production and business company must receive a certificate of knowledge about ATTP. However, it does not mention the other category of individuals who can receive such a certificate, namely, 'Người trực tiếp sản xuất kinh doanh' (people directly involved in food production and business). The generated answer provides a relevant piece of information, but it is not comprehensive."
