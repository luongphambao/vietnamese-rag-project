Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a similar range of fines for 'lỗi lái xe lạng lách' (reckless driving), which is related to the original answer's range of 'phạt tiền từ 10.000.000 đồng đến 12.000.000 đồng' (fines from 10,000,000 to 12,000,000 VND). However, the generated answer also includes additional information about the possibility of having their driving license suspended for a few months, which is not present in the original answer, making it 'partly relevant'."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer mentions the phrase 'mức phạt tối đa' (maximum fine), which is relevant to the original answer, it also provides a different conclusion ('không có' - no fine) than the original answer. The original answer specifies a specific fine range (Phạt tiền từ 10.000.000 đồng đến 12.000.000 đồng), which is not mentioned in the generated answer. The generated answer's context is also different, focusing on the absence of records about a specific traffic violation, whereas the original answer provides a factual statement about a fine range."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the context and relevance of the original answer, as it also mentions a fine value for a traffic offense (lạng lách xe ô tô). However, the fine range provided (800.000 - 1.000.000 đồng) is not entirely accurate and is much lower than the original answer (10.000.000 - 12.000.000 đồng). The generated answer lacks the precision and magnitude of the original answer, making it only partly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant as it mentions the same fine range as the original answer (6.000.000 đồng to 8.000.000 đồng), but it also lacks essential context and fails to provide a clear explanation of the infringement. The original answer specifically refers to using one's foot to control a motorcycle, which is not mentioned in the generated answer. Overall, while the generated answer conveys similar information, it is not as comprehensive as the original answer."

NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer as it provides a different fine range (1.000.000 - 2.000.000 dong) and asks a different question than the original answer. The original answer states that the fine for using foot to control a motorcycle is from 6.000.000 to 8.000.000 dong, but the generated answer does not mention this information and provides a different fine range. Additionally, the question asked in the generated answer is also different from the original answer, making the generated answer non-relevant to the original."

RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a specific detail about the time period required for temporary residence to qualify to vote for local council representatives, which is relevant to the original answer 'Không đủ điều kiện' (Not eligible). The answer provides a clarification on the condition for temporary residence and registration, making it relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides a similar restriction on the temporary resident's ability to participate in the electoral activities. Both answers state that the individual is not allowed to participate, but the generated answer provides a specific reason and duration for the restriction, which is similar to the original answer's implication."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer, as both provide information about the requirements for a person to be eligible to vote for a district-level People's Council representative. The generated answer mentions the requirement of being a temporary resident for over 12 months, which is related to the idea of 'Không đủ điều kiện' (not being eligible) mentioned in the original answer."

The generated answer expands on the original answer by providing specific examples and conditions, making it a relevant response."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides a specific guidance on the condition for voting as a temporary resident in the district-level People's Council election. Although the original answer is a simple phrase 'Không đủ điều kiện', the generated answer provides a detailed explanation of the condition, which is a direct response to the generated question. The generated answer accurately addresses the question and provides relevant information, making it a relevant response."
