Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information about the process of issuing government bonds in Vietnam, but it is not directly related to the original answer's statement about the Ministry of Finance ( Bộ Tài chính) being the organization responsible for issuing government bonds and implementing related duties. The generated answer focuses more on the procedure and requirements for issuing government bonds, whereas the original answer emphasizes the Ministry's role and responsibilities."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by mentioning the possibility of Bộ Tài chính delegating responsibility to a different entity (Thủ tướng Chính phủ) to issue government debt instruments. However, the generated answer does not accurately reflect the original text, which specifically mentions Kho bạc Nhà nước as the entity responsible for issuing government debt instruments. The mention of Thủ tướng Chính phủ is not directly supported by the original text and introduces a new entity not mentioned in the original answer, which reduces the relevance of the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer includes most of the relevant information as in the original answer, such as registration numbers, owner, address, registration date, inspection schedule, and vessel specifications. However, it lacks 'ký hiệu thiết kế' and 'cơ sở thiết kế' information mentioned in the original answer. Moreover, it includes extraneous information like 'ngày chuyển đi, nơi chuyển' which is not present in the original answer. Overall, the generated answer is mostly relevant, but not entirely accurate."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partly overlaps with the information provided in the original answer. Both answers discuss data related to vessel inspection, but the generated answer focuses specifically on the inspection center's data, whereas the original answer covers a broader range of information, including the vessel's registration, inspection schedule, and certifications. Although some relevant information is present in the generated answer, it lacks essential details from the original answer, making it only partly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original question by mentioning that the certificate of safety is updated in the registration and inspection records, which is correct. However, it does not provide a specific time or timeframe for the update, which is the main focus of the original question. The answer also repeats the question, which is an artifact of the RAG system's generation process."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the authority responsible for deciding the destruction of accounting documents, which is related to the original answer's mention of 'Người đại diện theo pháp luật của Ngân hàng' (the person in charge of the bank) having the authority to make that decision. However, the generated answer inaccurately states that this authority belongs to 'Sở Kho bạc Nhà nước' (the State Treasury agency), whereas the original answer does not mention this specific entity. The relevance is partly due to the similar topic and authority, but the accuracy is lacking."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"While the generated answer mentions the need to be aware of certain things when disposing of expired accounting documents, it provides a new set of specific examples (e.g. hồ sơ, báo cáo quyết toán vốn đầu tư xây dựng cơ bản dự án thuộc nhóm A) that are not present in the original answer. The generated answer also shifts the focus from highlighting the importance of ensuring the documents are unusable to discussing the specific types of documents that need to be stored permanently. Although it touches upon the topic, it does not accurately represent the content and context of the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses ways to establish ownership, cancel mortgages, and decide on the cancellation of mortgages, which are all related to property and loan guarantees, whereas the original answer specifically talks about the destruction of accounting documents in a bank when their storage period is over, and the methods to ensure they cannot be reused. The generated answer lacks relevance to the original question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the same topic, but provides more context and specific information about the types of accounting documents and their storage periods. While it references the need to destroy documents to ensure confidentiality, it does not directly respond to the question about whether the accounting documents should be destroyed according to regulations. The answer provides additional information, but the relevance to the original answer is limited."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions some key points related to identifying and addressing gender issues in law, such as promoting gender equality, preventing gender discrimination, and ensuring equal opportunities for men and women. However, the tone and scope of the generated answer are more general and lack the specific focus on analyzing social relationships and societal context found in the original answer. The generated answer also does not explicitly mention the need to consider the specific characteristics of each gender, which is a key aspect of the original answer."
