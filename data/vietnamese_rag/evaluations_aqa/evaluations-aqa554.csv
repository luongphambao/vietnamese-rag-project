RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer in terms of content, with the same range of fines (100,000 to 200,000 VND) being mentioned. Although the language and sentence structure differ, the answer conveys the same information as the original answer, making it directly relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains similar information to the original answer, specifically the fine range (100.000 - 200.000 đồng) for not using headlights while driving a motorcycle in foggy conditions. The generated answer accurately extracts and paraphrases the relevant information from the original answer, making it relevant and matching the intent."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it mentions the specific conditions under which the state can hold a controlling stake in a company. The answer is similar to the original answer in terms of the context, the mentioned fields, and the provided conditions. The main difference is that the original answer provides more general information and does not specify the percentage of state ownership, while the generated answer is more specific and details the percentage of state ownership in certain cases. Overall, the generated answer is informative and accurate, providing the necessary information on when the state can hold a controlling stake in a company."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer. The original answer discusses the percentage of state ownership in a state-owned enterprise when it is converted into a joint-stock company, and the factors that influence this percentage. The generated answer, on the other hand, talks about the types of companies that invest in securities or manage investment funds, which is a completely different topic and does not address the question of state ownership in agricultural enterprises."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the main point of the original text, which is that the state may not hold a majority stake in a company that does not fall under a specific category. However, it does not explicitly mention the details provided in the original text regarding the sectors, geographic regions, and national security aspects. The generated answer also rephrases the question as part of its response, which is not present in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer touches on a related aspect of the original answer, which discusses the stakeholding ratio in a state-owned company being converted into a joint-stock company. The generated answer mentions the importance of ensuring the ownership ratio to protect the rights of shareholders and relevant parties. Although the generated answer doesn't directly address the specific context of the original answer, it relates to a similar theme. However, it lacks the specific details and examples provided in the original answer, making it less relevant overall."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it directly addresses the question about which agencies have the authority to approve the restructuring plan of a state-owned agricultural company. The generated answer cites the same agencies mentioned in the original text (Bộ, ngành, Ủy ban nhân dân tỉnh và tập đoàn, tổng công ty nhà nước) as those that will determine the specific ownership ratio of the state. Although it does not provide the same level of detail as the original text, it provides a concise and accurate answer to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the exact same information and format. The only difference is that the generated answer is a direct response to a question, whereas the original answer is a part of a longer text. The answer still accurately conveys the relevant information about the fined amount for changing the color of a car."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer in terms of the information presented. Both answers discuss the fine amount for changing the color of a vehicle. However, the generated answer phrases it in a more explicit and direct manner, using 'according to the provided context', which adds clarity but not necessarily accuracy to the original context. Nonetheless, the core information is preserved and accurately transferred, making it a relevant response."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of the fine range. The original answer mentions the fine range as '600.000 đồng đến 800.000 đồng' for organizations, while the generated answer provides a more limited range of '200.000 đồng đến 400.000 đồng'. Although the ranges don't match exactly, the generated answer still conveys a similar idea of a potential fine for organizations."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains some relevant information, specifically the mention of violating regulations related to vehicle components (e.g., còi, đèn soi biển số, đèn báo hãm, gương chiếu hậu). However, it goes beyond what is mentioned in the original answer, which focuses specifically on changing the car color without permission. The generated answer also includes additional irrelevant information (e.g., using còi not according to standards) and details not mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially corresponds to the original answer in terms of the topic and the type of penalty (fine). However, the specific figures and deadline mentioned in the original answer (300,000-500,000 VND and within a specified time) are not present in the generated answer, which mentions 3,000,000-5,000,000 VND without specifying a deadline. The generated answer still conveys the main idea of a fine for not implementing the procedures, but lacks specificity."
