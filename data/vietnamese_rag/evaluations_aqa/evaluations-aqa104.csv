Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer in terms of content and context. Both answers provide the same information about the purpose of buying fake money and the location where it was purchased. The only difference is that the generated answer is a repetition of the original sentence, but it still conveys the same meaning and relevance to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately extracts the specific location (chợ Lũng Vài, Trung Quốc) mentioned in the original answer, which is partially relevant to the original answer. Although the generated question was about the country where the fake money was purchased, the generated answer focuses on the specific location instead of the country, it's still relevant to the original answer as it provides complementary information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it accurately restates the same information. The generated answer also maintains the same structure and context, with the goal of reselling counterfeit money in Vietnam being restated in the same sentence."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not related to the topic discussed in the original answer, which is about objects purchasing fake money at Chợ Lũng Vài in China. The generated answer instead provides a neutral statement about the lack of information about Chợ Lũng Vài's location. The context and content of the generated answer are not relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the main reason for Pogba's red card, which is also mentioned in the original answer (giẫm vào bắp chân Hector Bellerin). However, the generated answer lacks the context of the game (Arsenal vs. MU) and the impact of the red card on the team's future matches. The original answer provides more detailed information about the game and its potential consequences, which is not present in the generated answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer, which describes Paul Pogba's direct red card in a Manchester United match and its impact on the team's game. The generated question asks about Poker and the answer simply states that there is no information available, which is completely unrelated to the original context."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer barely relates to the original answer's content. The original answer talks about Pogba receiving a red card, affecting MU's lineup in a derby match against Man City, and potentially losing an opportunity to shine. The generated answer shifts the focus to the team's instability under Mourinho, which is not directly related to the original answer's context."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly contradicts the original answer by stating that there is no information about the benefits of dưa lê for skin, contradicting the original answer which discusses multiple benefits. This shows a complete mismatch between the generated answer and the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct extract from the original answer, focusing on the specific point about vitamin C in dưa lê helping to make skin look better. It retains the same structure and key phrases as the original answer, providing a very similar and relevant response to the generated question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly identifies the topic of treatment for sleep disorders, but it incorrectly states that the information is not mentioned in the text. In fact, the original text does mention the benefits of dưa lê for treating sleep disorders, among other conditions. The relevance is partly relevant as it touches on the correct topic, but the statement is factually inaccurate."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer as it mentions the benefits of dưa lê (watermelon) for pregnant women, specifically mentioning the high concentration of axit folic, which is consistent with the original answer. However, the generated answer focuses more on the general benefits for pregnant women rather than the comprehensive list of benefits provided in the original answer, including skin health, sleep, blood pressure, weight loss, and the prevention of muscle cramps."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question asked, but instead of providing a direct answer, it acknowledges that there is no information about dưa lê helping to prevent conditions in the legs or feet. This response is still relevant because it provides an honest answer, but it does not fully answer the question and therefore is not fully relevant."
