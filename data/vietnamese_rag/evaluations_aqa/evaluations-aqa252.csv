Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a duplicate of the original answer, but it does not provide any additional information or context. The relevance is PARTLY_RELEVANT because it repeats the same information, but does not provide any new insights or summaries, and does not deviate significantly from the original answer."
RELEVANT,The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides the same information about the reason for some officials being unable to arrive at their workplace on time. The generated answer also includes additional context about the flood situation and the efforts of the officials to help the residents. The only minor difference is the addition of a sentence about the bulk of officials and employees going down to the commune to guide the residents on how to cope with the flood's consequences. This additional information does not significantly change the relevance of the generated answer to the original answer.
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially stays within the context of the original question. It mentions that UBND xã Châu Tiến has taken actions to help people recover from the flood, which is relevant. However, the provided information is too general and lacks specific details about the actions taken by UBND xã Châu Tiến, as mentioned in the original answer. Additionally, the generated answer shifts focus to the involvement of the Union of Vietnamese Buddhist Associations (Ủy ban Trung ương MTTQ Việt Nam) which is not directly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer specifically answers the question 'Có bao nhiêu cán bộ UBND xã Châu Tiến bị cô lập tại bản Hoa Tiến do lũ lụt?' which is a direct spin-off of the original text. Although the generated answer is concise, it still conveys the same information as the original text, and the relevance is strong."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer as it mentions the reason for Indonesia's withdrawal from the match, which is being 'xử ép trắng trợn' (unfairly treated) by the referee. However, the generated answer lacks the detailed context and the emotional tone present in the original answer. It does not mention the initial score, the player's action, and the coach's reaction, which are important elements in the original answer. Therefore, while the generated answer captures the gist of the original answer, it is not entirely relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the core events and emotions described in the original answer, including the controversy surrounding the referee's decision and the team's decision to abandon the match. Although it doesn't exactly replicate the original wording, it conveys the same information and context, making it relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially but correctly addresses the question by mentioning specific actions taken by the SEA Games organization after Indonesia's team retreated. However, it lacks context and does not fully cover the entire scene. The original answer provides a broader explanation of the situation, including the score, the team's exit, and the coach's reaction. The generated answer focuses only on the SEA Games organization's response, which makes it less relevant compared to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct quotation of HLV Asry Syam's statement about the reason for Indonesia's team withdrawal, which aligns with the original answer. The answer provides detailed information about the unfair refereeing, the score of 16-10, and the team's decision to leave the game, which matches the original answer's content and context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially conveys the same information as the original answer, mentioning the result of the game (Indonesia's withdrawal) and the context surrounding it (the score being 16-10, the sudden stoppage of the game by the referee, and Indonesia's coach pleading with the team to leave the field). However, the generated answer lacks some details and emotional tone present in the original answer, such as Indonesia's coach's upset expression and the attempt to save the game by the organizers. Despite this, the generated answer remains largely accurate and stays on topic, making it partly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct response to the generated question 'Phạm Băng Băng là con gái của ai?' and provides the same information as the original answer, which is that Phạm Băng Băng is the daughter of Phạm Đào. The difference is only in the wording and format, but the content and meaning remain the same, indicating a relevant response."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer. The original answer talks about Phạm Băng Băng being Phạm Đào and his occupation as a singer, while the generated answer is a denial that Phạm Đào is mentioned in any documents and therefore cannot be answered. The generated answer has no connection to the original answer and does not provide any relevant information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is directly related to the original answer, providing the same information about Phạm Đào's career as a singer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'Phạm Đào không thuộc đoàn nghệ thuật nào được cung cấp trong văn bản' is not relevant to the original answer 'Cha của Phạm Băng Băng là Phạm Đào, từng là ca sĩ Đoàn nghệ thuật thủy quân lục chiến. Vì vậy, ông sở hữu giọng hát không hề thua kém các ca sĩ nổi tiếng.' The generated answer is actually answering a different question and providing a contradictory statement, which is not related to the original answer's content or context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, with the same structure and key points. The only difference is the repetition of the question at the beginning of the generated answer. The content of the generated answer matches the original answer, discussing Phạm Đào's background as a musician and his comparing his singing voice with famous singers. The evaluation is relevant as it addresses the question and provides similar information as the original answer."
