RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, with only minor differences in wording. The generated answer accurately mentions the context and event where the Cờ thi đua was presented, which matches the information in the original answer.%"
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information about the Cờ thi đua being awarded to Nghệ An province, but the context and content are not identical to the original answer. The original answer specifically mentions Đồng chí Nguyễn Xuân Phúc's presence at the event, whereas the generated answer does not mention this detail."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the impact of ISIS's activities on education in Iraq, mentioning the destruction of schools and the promotion of extremist ideologies. However, it lacks specific details and examples provided in the original answer, such as the consequences for children who were forced to learn IS's curriculum for 2 years after the liberation of Mosul. The generated answer also omits the mention of children's fear of attending school in IS-controlled areas."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it mentions the same reasons why many parents in Iraq would not want their children to attend schools managed by IS. Both answers highlight IS' manipulation of schools to promote extremist and radical beliefs, and the impact on children's education. The generated answer is not a verbatim copy of the original, but it maintains the same essential information and context."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely relevant to the original answer because it accurately summarizes the challenges that Iraqi children face in acquiring knowledge after being subjected to IS's curriculum. Although the generated answer does not cover all the points mentioned in the original answer, such as the fear among parents and the need for additional knowledge, it echoes the idea that Iraqi children need to overcome the educational obstacles caused by IS."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately and partially corresponds to the relevant information in the original answer. It correctly answers the part of the question related to the number of passengers Flybe had to compensate, which is 87. However, it does not provide the additional information mentioned in the original answer about the compensation amount, the reason for the flight being diverted back to Birmingham, or the fine imposed on Kieran Tabberner."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the correct reason for the flight having to turn back (Kieran Tabberner's behavior towards the flight attendant), but it contains additional and inaccurate details (e.g. the plane returning to Birmingham instead of just being forced to turn back) and omits some key information (e.g. the monetary damages) present in the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is completely unrelated to the original answer. The generated answer provides a converted amount in Vietnamese currency, which is not mentioned in the original answer, and does not address the question about the components of the nearly 70,000 USD cost. The original answer provides a breakdown of the cost into two parts, namely the compensation to passengers and the cost of rerouting the flight, whereas the generated answer is unrelated to these details."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question and provides the correct information about the passenger who caused the controversy on the flight, which is Kieran Tabberner. The answer is highly specific and relevant to the original answer, which also mentions Kieran Tabberner as the passenger involved in the controversy."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is almost identical to the original answer, providing the exact same information about Kieran Tabberner's fine, which is 1.550 bảng. The relevance is high because the generated answer has the same key information as the original answer, and is not a summary or a paraphrase of the original information."

The generated answer is a passage about a contest, mentioning a number of submissions, but it doesn't provide the answer to the question 'Số lượng cộng đồng người Việt Nam tại Jeonju là bao nhiêu?' which is asking for the number of Vietnamese community in Jeonju. The original answer is a specific numerical value, while the generated answer is a long passage with unrelated information."
