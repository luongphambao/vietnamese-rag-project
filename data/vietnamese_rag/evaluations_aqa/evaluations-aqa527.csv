Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of mentioning additional forms of punishment besides fines, such as tước quyền sử dụng giấy phép lái xe. However, the exact duration and specific measures mentioned in the original answer are not included in the generated answer, and the phrase 'đắm phương tiện, đình chỉ' is not present in the original answer, which makes the generated answer less relevant."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer completely misinterprets the original answer and changes the context. The original answer provides specific information about fines and penalties for traffic violations, while the generated answer tries to analyze the absence of information on a specific topic and describes unrelated regulations."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a question that replicates the original question, failing to provide any relevant information or answer to the original answer. The original answer provides specific details about the fine and punishment for violating traffic regulations, while the generated answer does not add any new information and is not related to the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer includes an incorrect statement ('giết rác' which means 'kill garbage') and is not related to the original answer's mention of 'thu dọn rác' (cleaning up the trash) as a consequence of the fine. The generated answer also does not mention the other details present in the original answer, such as the fine range, suspension of driving license, and restoration of the original state."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer. The original answer explains situations where the contractor has the right to refuse warranty, whereas the generated answer provides conditions for a contractor to avoid performing warranty (not the same context). The generated answer also introduces unrelated information about fines for not following a certain process, which further deviates from the original answer's topic."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions some relevant points, such as the idea of responsibility exemption, but the specific circumstances mentioned (different agency/organization or direct management) are not exactly the same as the original answer's cases (damage not caused by the contractor or force majeure). The generated answer seems to be related but not directly addressing the original answer's concerns."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer touches on the topic of the original answer, mentioning the possibility of a contractor refusing to provide warranty, but its details and specific cases are not directly related to the original answer. The original answer specifically mentions cases where the contractor is not responsible for damages, whereas the generated answer provides general regulations and conditions for the contractor to refuse warranty."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the main point of the original answer, which is that the Bureau of Technique and Environment Industry (BCT) conducts a mid-term inspection and evaluation based on the report. The generated answer provides more detailed information and context, but the core idea of the original answer is preserved."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer. Both mention the topic of evaluation based on the intermediate report's results. However, the generated answer goes into more details about the specific items being evaluated (opinions of level authorities and the assessment of enterprise managers) whereas the original answer is more general in mentioning the 'tình hình thực hiện nhiệm vụ bảo vệ môi trường' (implementation status of environmental protection tasks). Additionally, the tone and form of the generated answer are different from the original answer, which is more formal and structural."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions the concept of biên bản kiểm tra giữa kỳ (mid-term inspection report) and Mẫu (template). However, the generated answer is not entirely accurate as it provides a specific template number (Mẫu số 03) and a reference to a Nghị định (Decree), which is not mentioned in the original answer. The original answer only mentions a specific mẫu (template) number, but it is not Mẫu số 03."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the generated question, providing the name of the sample report form ('Biểu C1 BCTK ĐT, DA và Phụ lục 3'). However, it does not mention the original sample report form mentioned in the original answer ('mẫu B4b-BBKTGK-BCT') nor provide the correct information about the report form being sent to Cục Kỹ thuật an toàn và Môi trường công nghiệp. It also seems to be related to a different report form, mentioned in Thông tư, which is not present in the original context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question, but the provided information is not entirely accurate. The original answer focuses on the responsibility of updating information of members in the register of members, whereas the generated answer discusses the non-existence of a specific responsibility mentioned in a context.
