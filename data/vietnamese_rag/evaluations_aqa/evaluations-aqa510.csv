Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it mentions the same convention (Công ước về buôn bán quốc tế các loài động vật, thực vật hoang dã nguy cấp) and refers to the same list of endangered species (Phụ lục I). The generated answer also provides additional information about the types of species that will be included in this list, which is similar to the information presented in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of content. Both answers mention the role of the Bộ Nông nghiệp và Phát triển nông thôn in relation to endangered species. However, the generated answer adds additional context by addressing the specific question of whether the ministry is responsible for species classification, which is not present in the original answer. Additionally, the generated answer includes the original answer verbatim, which may be seen as copying. Overall, while the generated answer is partially relevant, it does not provide a novel or substantially different answer, and it includes unnecessary repetition of the original text."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer as it mentions the same document (Thông tư số 40/2013/TT-BNNPTNT) and the same topic (CITES Convention). However, the generated answer focuses on the update mechanism (through Nghị định and Công ước) whereas the original answer provided the definition of endangered species. The generated answer does not fully capture the essence of the original answer, which makes it PARTLY_RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by explaining the purpose of the Danh mục các loài động vật, thực vật hoang dã có nguy cơ tuyệt chủng. However, it does not explicitly mention the original answer, which specifically refers to the Danh mục các loài động vật, thực vật hoang dã quy định trong các phụ lục của Công ước về buân bán quốc tế các loài động vật, thực vật hoang dã nguy cấp. The generated answer also goes beyond the scope of the original answer by mentioning the goals of conservation and sustainability, which were not mentioned in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately adds two key pieces of information ('biện pháp phòng ngừa để sử dụng an toàn' and 'thời hạn sử dụng') to the original specification of information required on the label, matching the original answer's content and structure."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a similar purpose for labeling the equipment containing chemicals, but it lacks the exact wording and detail in the original answer. The generated answer uses 'an toàn' instead of 'an toàn' and 'nguy hiểm' instead of 'nguy cơ'. Although the main idea is preserved, the specific phrases and words used are not identical to the original answer, resulting in a partly relevant evaluation."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially aligns with the original answer. The generated answer mentions the importance of labeling chemical containers with required information, which is also present in the original answer. However, the generated answer provides more specific details about the regulations and types of containers, which are not entirely relevant to the original answer's focus on general labeling requirements."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is closely related to the original answer, as it correctly states that hình đồ cảnh báo and cảnh báo nguy cơ are mandatory information on the labeling of chemicals. The generated answer also includes additional information mentioned in the original answer, such as tên hoá chất, công thức hoá học, biện pháp phòng ngừa để sử dụng an toàn, and thời hạn sử dụng. The only minor difference is that the generated answer repeats some of the information from the original answer, but it remains relevant and accurate overall."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original question about the definition of ranh giới for phân khu công nghiệp. However, it does so only indirectly by referencing a decree (Nghị định) and providing the specific definition from it. There is no direct answer to the original question, and the answer includes a lot of extraneous information. The relevance is partial because it does mention the definition of ranh giới, but it does not directly provide the answer to the question asked."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer mentions the purpose of dividing industrial zones, it does not specifically mention the connection to 'ranh giới được xác định, phù hợp với quy hoạch xây dựng của khu công nghiệp' in the original answer. The generated answer is related to the purpose of dividing industrial zones, but it does not fully capture the relevance and context of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original question by mentioning some of the services provided at the industrial zone, such as phát triển khu công nghiệp hỗ trợ, hình thành liên kết sản xuất between zones, đổi mới cơ cấu, and các doanh nghiệp. However, it also includes additional information that is not directly related to the original answer, such as chuyển giao công nghệ, kỹ năng sản xuất tiên tiến, and hợp tác đầu tư, kinh doanh. The generated answer is not entirely relevant to the original answer, but it does contain some relevant information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information about the differences between a industrial zone and a sub-industrial zone, such as their functions, positions, scales, and requirements. However, it is not entirely relevant as the original answer only focuses on the definition and characteristics of a sub-industrial zone, without explicitly discussing its differences with an industrial zone. Additionally, the generated answer introduces new information about the formation of sub-industrial zones, which is not present in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a specific detail about the mechanism of breaking the market circuit in the stock market, which is similar to the original answer.
