Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is directly related to the original answer, as it provides the same reason for the recall of 320,000 vehicles. The only difference is that the original answer is phrased differently, focusing on the potential cause of fires, while the generated answer provides the specific reason for the recall. The context and content of the generated answer match the original answer, making it highly relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the same problem and provides the same solution as the original answer, mentioning the specific component (bộ phận cấp điện) on the car that may cause a short circuit. Although the wording is similar, the generated answer is a direct replication of the original answer, which is a significant similarity."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, with identical content and context. The only difference is the inclusion of the specific brand 'Nissan' which does not affect the relevance of the answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions 'sơn phủ' (painting) which is related to the original answer, which also mentions 'sơn phủ' (painting) as being the issue. However, the generated answer focuses on the specific standards that are not met ('sơn phủ cho hiệu ứng gạch, hiệu ứng kính cường lực'), which is not directly related to the original answer which mentions the risk of short-circuit due to uncoated electrical components."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is fully relevant to the original answer, as it presents the same information and context, just in a different form (answering 'Nguy cơ gì mà Nissan phải triệu hồi xe?' with 'Nguy cơ chập cháy do một bộ phận cấp điện trên xe không được sơn phủ đạt tiêu chuẩn, có thể gây chập mạch.')."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, as it contains the same important information and quotes the same phrases. The content and context are almost identical, suggesting that the RAG system effectively retrieved and generated relevant information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly relevant to the original answer because it accurately captures the key point about Từ Hiểu Đông thinking Yi Long is not worthy to fight him. The sentence structure and wording are simple and straightforward, mirroring the original answer. However, it may be considered less relevant because it lacks the nuance and additional details provided in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly identical to the original answer, only minor wording and sentence structure differences exist. The content and context remain intact, indicating high relevance to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer. It correctly quotes the suggestion made by Từ Hiểu Đông to Yi Long if they lack money, namely to go directly to his company because there is still a prize fund. However, the generated answer lacks the nuance and context provided in the original answer, which also mentions that Từ Hiểu Đông is confident in his own abilities and would defeat Yi Long in a fight if necessary. The generated answer oversimplifies the original statement and does not capture the full extent of Từ Hiểu Đông's intention."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the essence of the original answer, as it mentions the advice to go to Hiểu Đông's company for the reward fund when lacking money. However, it omits the context of Hiểu Đông's previous attitude towards Yi Long, such as being 'ngạo mạn' (haughty) and the additional condition 'tùy khi Yi Long muốn đấu vì tiền' (if Yi Long wants to fight for money). This reduced context and omittance of some details result in a PARTLY_RELEVANT evaluation."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer only mentions one individual (Rattanai Songsangchan) as unable to participate at SEA Games due to injury, whereas the original answer mentions four individuals (Rattanai Songsangchan, Suriya Singmui, Chaiwat Buran, and Chenrop Samphaodi) with varying degrees of injury, with only Rattanai Songsangchan being certain to miss SEA Games. The generated answer is relevant to the question but fails to capture the full range of information provided in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, providing the same list of players who suffered serious injuries. The only difference is that the generated answer does not mention the follow-up information about Rattanai Songsangchan not being able to participate in SEA Games. The generated answer stays focused on the initial question and provides a relevant answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely matches the original answer in terms of content and context. The generated answer provides the same list of players who are injured before SEA Games, which is exactly what the provided question is asking for. The only difference is that the generated answer does not provide additional information about the recovery of Rattanai Songsangchan, which is mentioned in the original answer. However, this does not significantly impact the relevance of the answer to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is based on the original answer and provides the same information, just in a different format (answering the generated question instead of providing a list). It accurately reports the names of the injured players and is less than 10% different from the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the players Chaiwat Buran, Suriya Singmui, and Chenrop Samphaodi are currently playing in the Shogun League and won the Junker Cup Championships, which is unrelated to the original answer's context and content. The original answer discussed the injuries and status of the players, while the generated answer provides updated information about their current activities and achievements, but it doesn't follow the original context or address the questions the user is looking for."
