Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly mentions another use of the REMUS 600, which is surveillance, and this is consistently mentioned in the original answer as a possible use. The context and content of the generated answer match the original answer, indicating high relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially repeats the original answer, confirming that the unmanned REMUS 600 submarine can be detected by surveillance equipment. However, it also adds a sentence that mentions its potential use for reconnaissance activities, which is not present in the original answer. This duplication of information makes it PARTLY_RELEVANT, but not entirely relevant as it contains additional information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately provides the reason for the cultural exchange festival being organized annually, which is to commemorate Bác Hồ's letter to the General Meeting of Ethnic Minorities in the South and also as an activity commemorating Vietnamese Ethnic Cultural Day (April 19th). The content and context of the generated answer are very similar to the original answer, indicating high relevance."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a specific date range (27-29/10) for the cultural festival, which is not mentioned in the original answer. The original answer only mentions the date 19/4, which is different from the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, as it provides the same information and corrects the minor grammar mistake. The generated answer also includes additional details from the original answer, specifically the dates, demonstrating a strong match in terms of content and context."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is completely unrelated to the original answer. The topics and context are vastly different, with the original answer talking about a cultural event celebrating the Vietnamese culture and the generated answer mentioning Manchester United soccer players and their girlfriends."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely matches the original answer, rephrasing the time period '38 năm' in a similar manner. The only difference is the rephrasing, which does not affect the relevance of the answer. The generated answer provides the same information as the original answer, making it relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides specific information about Lữ Anh Dồi's rank, which is Thiếu úy, which is the same as mentioned in the original answer. Although the context is different (original answer mentions 'truy tặng bằng Tổ quốc ghi công' and generated question asks about the rank), the information provided is accurate and relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mirrors the original question, but not the original answer. It lacks the specific information about Thiếu úy Lữ Anh Dồi, and instead, repeats the question. While it somewhat reuses the original context, it fails to provide the desired answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'Bằng Tổ quốc ghi công được trao cho ai?' is a rephrased version of the question, but it does not contain any relevant information to the original answer 'Thiếu úy Lữ Anh Dồi đã được truy tặng bằng Tổ quốc ghi công sau 38 năm'. Additionally, the provided additional information about Đồng chí Nguyễn Xuân Phúc traumatating a Cờ thi đua to a province is unrelated to the original answer and the generated answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not provide any relevant information to the original answer. The original answer discusses Phạm Ngọc Kim Ngân's relationship and weight, while the generated answer is a restatement of the question, and then confirms that she does not have any information in the given context. There is no connection or relevance between the two."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated question and answer are not identical to the original answer, the generated answer does contain the same information (120 kg) mentioned in the original answer. The context is also closely related, as both discuss the weight of Phạm Ngọc Kim Ngân. The main difference is that the generated answer is a direct response to the generated question, whereas the original answer is part of a larger sentence about Phạm Ngọc Kim Ngân's wedding photo and her husband's care. Despite this difference, the generated answer is still relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches with the original answer. The generated answer only answers part of the question which is the name of the bride (Phạm Ngọc Kim Ngân), but the question was asking for more information about the wedding photo set, not just the name of the bride.
