PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by mentioning the fine range for a specific behavior (violation of motor vehicle plate regulations).

The generated answer also omits the specific points mentioned in the original text (a), (b), and (c) in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer because it provides a correct and relevant piece of information, which is the penalty for an vehicle with expired inspection certificate. However, the range of the fine (2.000.000 - 3.000.000 VND) is not provided in the original answer, and the specific cases mentioned in the original answer (device control and registration) are not matched in the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, with almost identical wording and content. The only minor difference is the removal of the phrase 'Bản chất là' which is not crucial to the conveyed meaning. Overall, the generated answer accurately responds to the generated question and conveys the same information as the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, providing the same information about the level or category of region A4 compared to A1, A2, and A3. Although the wording is slightly different, the core idea and meaning are the same, making it consider relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions that Vùng biển A4 is defined based on the geographical scale of UNESCO, which partially aligns with the original answer. However, the original answer mentions that Vùng biển A4 is beyond the scope of A1, A2, and A3, and includes zones 70° North to the North Pole and 70° South to the South Pole, whereas the generated answer does not provide the same level of specificity and context."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides specific coordinates (05°00’ to 11°30’ vĩ độ Bắc, from 104°00’ to 109°30’ kinh độ Đông) and details about the region within the Biển Đông, which is completely different from the original answer. The original answer mentions that Biển A4 is an area outside of Biển A1, A2, and A3, while the generated answer describes a specific region within the Biển Đông. The two answers do not share any similarities, making the generated answer non-relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"While the generated answer does mention the Vicinity degree (Vi độ) in Vùng biển A4, it only provides a specific temperature range of 25°C-28°C, which is not a direct answer to the original answer.

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the generated question, providing the range of fines for changing a TV channel's logo, from 50 million to 200 million VND. Although it mentions specific fine ranges, it does not explicitly state that changing the logo without approval will result in a fine. This falls short of accurately capturing the original answer's key information."

Overall, the generated answer is relevant to the original answer but also adds new information that is not directly related to the original question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it provides a fine range of 32.000.000 - 40.000.000 dong for the fine amount, which is similar to the original answer providing a range of 1.000.000 - 5.000.000 dong.
