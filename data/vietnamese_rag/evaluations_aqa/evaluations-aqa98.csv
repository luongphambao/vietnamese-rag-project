Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it maintains the core topic of Pakistan's stance on the war on terror in Afghanistan and its relationship with the US. Although the generated answer rephrases and adds more details, it remains faithful to the original answer in conveying Pakistan's distrust of the US and the US's accusations against Pakistan."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it directly quotes the same statement by the Pakistani Defense Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan, which is also present in the original answer. The answer accurately conveys the same information and context as the original answer, making it a nearly identical match."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, meaning it accurately summarizes the event that led to the cessation of military and intelligence cooperation between Pakistan and the US. Both answers mention the suspension of US military aid to Islamabad by President Donald Trump and the subsequent response from Pakistan's Defense Minister, Khurram Dastgir Khan. The relevance is higher than 'PARTLY_RELEVANT' as the generated answer accurately replicates the original answer, without any significant deviations or omissions."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the date mentioned in the original answer, which is the date of Kenneka Jenkins' death, making it a relevant response."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly correct in providing the location of Kenneka Jenkins' death, which is the same as in the original answer. However, it is missing the detail about the refrigeration room being active but not in use to store food, which is an important context in the original answer. Overall, the generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer but lacks a crucial detail."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely corresponds to the original answer. Both mention the investigator's theory on the cause of Kenneka Jenkins' death, specifically that she died due to intoxication and finding her own death. The only difference is that the original answer provides additional context about the discovery of her body in the freezer, which is not present in the generated answer. However, the core information and theory are accurately reproduced, making the generated answer relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original sentence about the mother not trusting the investigation's cause of death. However, the generated answer incorrectly states that the cause of death was the daughter being drunk and finding her own death, which is not mentioned in the original answer. The original answer only mentions that the death investigation concluded that the daughter died after being drunk and finding her own death, but the mother disagrees with this conclusion."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is loosely related to the original answer, as it discusses the limitations of the secondary screen on the back of the phone. However, it fails to capture the detail about being able to access information from the phone without looking at the front screen, and also does not mention the ability to use the secondary screen as a trackpad or notification shade. The generated answer is more focused on the limitations of the feature, whereas the original answer covers its potential uses as well."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information about the Meizu PRO 7 having a SuperAMOLED screen on the back, which displays time, notifications, and similar functions as the small screen on top of the phone. However, it only partially addresses the original answer's mention of the screen at the rear being capable of responding to touch input, access to information from the phone without looking at the front, or using the screen as a trackpad or notification shade. The generated answer does not clearly explain how the phone determines whether the touch input is on the front or back screen."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the concern of user confusion between the front and back of the phone when having a second screen at the back, which is a major topic discussed in the original answer. The generated answer highlights the uncertainty around the second screen's responsiveness to touch and how it might lead to user confusion, which is in line with the original answer's discussion on the same topic."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer. While it mentions the correct vehicle (Isuzu MotorHome) and event (VMS 2017), it also includes additional information (color, 'màu trắng') that is not present in the original answer. Furthermore, the structure of the sentence is different, with the generated answer providing more explicit information about the event."
