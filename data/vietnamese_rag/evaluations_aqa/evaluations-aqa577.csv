Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer in terms of structure and format, but the penalty range values are different. The generated answer is also missing the specific penalty range for organizations, which is present in the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer. The original answer provides a range of fines for individuals and organizations, whereas the generated answer specifically addresses the maximum fine for an individual committing a specific traffic violation (treo biểu ngữ vi phạm luật giao thông). The topics and contexts are different."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer as it also mentions fines for organizational entities. However, the range of fines mentioned in the generated answer (20,000,000 - 30,000,000 VND) differs significantly from the original answer (1,000,000 - 2,000,000 VND). The context of the generated question (treo biển quảng cáo vi phạm giao thông) is also different from the original answer, which does not specify the type of infraction."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information related to the original answer, which discusses the fine amounts for individual and organization for violating traffic safety rules. However, the generated answer provides specific information about fine amounts and circumstances, whereas the original answer is a general statement. The generated answer is more specific and detailed, but not directly related to the original answer's context and information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, with identical sentences and phrases. The only difference is the added phrase 'rzejz' at the end, which is likely an error and does not affect the relevance of the answer. Therefore, the generated answer is considered relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer. Both answers share the same content and phrasing, almost verbatim. The generated answer simply rephrases the original answer to form a question. This suggests that the RAG system is able to effectively retrieve and generate relevant information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information about the organization that collaborate with the Total General Department in the local defense work, specifically mentioning the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Planning and Investment. However, the original answer emphasizes the responsibility of the Total General Department in leading and coordinating with other agencies, organizations, and localities to implement national defense tasks, which is not fully captured in the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a relevant range of fine for the specified behavior (organizing rest and recreation in a strict protection area of a special-use forest), but the fine amount is too high (25,000,000 - 35,000,000 VND compared to the original fine amount of 5,000,000 - 10,000,000 VND). The generated answer also misses the exact upper limit of 10,000,000 VND mentioned in the original answer, which reduces its relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer in terms of content, accurately providing the fine range for the specific behavior mentioned in the original answer. The context is also correct, as both answers refer to the same scenario of organizing recreational activities in a protected area of a special-use forest."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly quotes the same fine range (5,000,000 - 10,000,000 VND) from the original answer, indicating a high similarity and relevance between the two. The generated question is also related to the content of the original answer, supporting the relevance of the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some information relevant to the original answer. Specifically, it provides a specific value (70,000,000 đồng) as the maximum fine for violating the regulations in a strictly protected area. However, it does not provide the full range of fines as mentioned in the original answer (5,000,000 - 10,000,000 đồng). The generated answer is partly relevant as it provides some accurate information, but lacks important context and completeness."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a different fine range compared to the original answer, and is not directly answering the question. The original answer specifically mentions a fine range for 'phát nghỉ dưỡng, giải trí' (organizing vacations, entertainment) in a strictly protected zone of a special use forest, whereas the generated answer is a general fine range for violating regulations in a strictly protected zone."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides a specific clarification on the rights of members with limited liability in a limited liability company. Although the original answer is a general statement, the generated answer provides supporting details from the company's charter, making it a relevant expansion on the original topic."
