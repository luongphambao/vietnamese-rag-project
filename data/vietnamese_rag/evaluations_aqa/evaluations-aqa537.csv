Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer only addresses the situation when the account runs out of money, which is not relevant to the original answer's discussion of the deadline (December 31, 2021) and the requirement to pay for installing an ETC (Electronic Toll Collection) tag from then on."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partly relevant because it acknowledges the presence of a fee, which is a crucial aspect of the original answer. However, the generated answer is not entirely consistent with the original answer, as it states that there is a fee for the first installation, which is contradicted by the original answer, which states that there is no fee for the first installation before December 31, 2021. The generated answer lacks the nuance and specificity of the original answer, making it less relevant overall."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the necessity to pay the fee for installation, which is semi-related to the original answer's point about having to pay for the label installation after a certain date. The added information about the prize withdrawal agreement is not relevant to the original answer's context and is a separate topic."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the generated question, not providing any relevant information to the original answer. The original answer discloses information about the service provider and the charge for attaching end tags, whereas the generated answer does not provide any relevant or related information to that."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it correctly defines 'nơi tạm trú' as a place where a person lives temporarily outside their permanent residence, and mentions the registration requirement.

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some related information about the cases where people who have registered for temporary residence may need to be removed from the temporary residence registration book, but it does not directly address the question of when to register for permanent residence and when to register for temporary residence.
