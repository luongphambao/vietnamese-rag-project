Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, including the same range of values (400,000 - 600,000 dong) and sentence structure, indicating a high level of relevance and similarity to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a relevant fine range, but the exact range is incorrect. The original answer mentions a fine range of 400,000 to 600,000 VND, whereas the generated answer suggests a range of 200,000 to 300,000 VND, which is a significant difference. However, the topic and context of the generated answer (fines for stopping on a bridge) are related to the original answer (fines for traffic violations), which makes it partly relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the same information and range of fines for stopping or parking a motorcycle on a bridge."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, as it also mentions the fine range of 100,000 to 200,000 dong for violating traffic law by using a fake ticket while taking a train."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer in terms of content and context. Both answers mention the fine range for using fake tickets when taking the train, with a specific amount of 100.000 đồng to 200.000 đồng. The generated answer accurately retrieves the relevant information from the original answer, making it relevant and accurate."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it provides an additional consequence of using a fake train ticket, which is confiscation of the fake ticket. The original answer mentions the possibility of a fine, but the generated answer adds more context by mentioning another possible penalty, making it a complementary answer rather than an unrelated one."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original question. The original question asks about the types of fake tickets used on a train, while the generated answer provides information about the types of fake tickets. Although both answers mention fake tickets, they do not address the same topic or provide relevant information. The original answer is specifically about the fines and warnings for using fake tickets, whereas the generated answer is about the types of fake tickets themselves."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it mentions the consequences of using a fake ticket, which is also mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer focuses more on the location that regulates the fine, whereas the original answer specifies the fine range. The generated answer lacks the crucial information about the fine range and provides a redundant statement."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the same topic as the original answer, namely the conditions for reducing the probationary period. However, the generated answer provides more detailed and specific conditions, such as the need to have conducted themselves well, to have learned from mistakes, and to have been rewarded by authorities. The original answer only mentions that the person must have conducted themselves well and must have fulfilled the conditions specified in Article 65 of the Penal Code. The generated answer provides additional information, but it is not entirely accurate, as it does not mention the specific condition of having conducted themselves well for three quarters of the probationary period."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer's content. Both answers mention the conditions for freeing up the remaining time for a probationary period. However, the generated answer omits the condition of having worked out at least three-quarters of the probationary period, as stated in the original answer. Additionally, the generated answer introduces new conditions that are not present in the original answer, such as strictly abiding by the law and being rewarded by a state agency."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant as it directly addresses the question 'Trường hợp nào Tòa án có thể rút ngắn hết thời gian thử thách?' and provides a clear explanation of the specific circumstances under which the court may shorten the remaining trial period, which is the same key point mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer also uses the same legal terminology and references the same legal article (khoản 1 Điều 65 Luật hình sự năm 2015) as the original answer, indicating a high degree of similarity and relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer in terms of content and context. Both answers discuss the role of Ủy ban nhân dân cấp tỉnh in implementing the program to mitigate the effects of bombs and mines after the war. The generated answer provides additional details from the original answer, but the core information is preserved. The main difference lies in the rephrasing and reorganization of the sentence structure."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the content and context of the original answer. While it does mention the role of Bộ Quốc phòng in the process of program development and appraisal, it does so unnecessarily elaborately and repeats some information. It also does not provide new insights or information that is not already present in the original answer. A more concise and focused answer would be more relevant."
