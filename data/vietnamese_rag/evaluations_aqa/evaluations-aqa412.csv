Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches with the original answer in terms of the factors mentioned. The original answer mentions 'chất lượng khoáng sản, quy mô khoáng sản, khả năng khai thác, sử dụng' as 'biểu hiện khoáng sản', whereas the generated answer rephrases the same points as 'chất lượng khoáng sản, quy mô khoáng sản, khả năng khai thác, sử dụng' as factors deciding the exploitation or use of 'biểu hiện khoáng sản'. Although the content is somewhat similar, the context and terminology used in the original answer are not entirely preserved in the generated answer, rendering it partially relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the concept of 'biểu hiện khoáng sản' as a collection of natural mineral materials with unknown size and exploitation potential, as mentioned in the original answer. However, it also includes additional information about 'tài nguyên khoáng sản nhỏ' having a discovered size, quality, and potential for exploitation, which is not present in the original answer. This combination of similarities and differences leads to a PARTLY_RELEVANT evaluation."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely matches the original answer, which is ‘Không phải thi sát hạch’ (Not to take an exam). The generated question is related to the original answer as it asks about the need for re-examination. The generated answer explicitly states that the answer is ‘không phải thi sát hạch’, aligning with the original answer. The relevance is high due to this exact matching and contextual connection to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely matches the original answer 'Không phải thi sát hạch.' The context and wording of the generated answer are identical to the original answer, implying a high degree of relevance to the original response."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is somewhat similar to the original answer, as it also mentions that it is possible to re-issue a lost construction certificate. However, the generated answer provides additional information and conditions for re-issuing the certificate, which makes it more comprehensive and accurate compared to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides information on the procedure for retrieving a lost construction certification, which is directly related to the original answer 'Không phải thi sát hạch', which declines the need for taking an exam. Although the tone and context are different, the generated answer addresses a topic that is coherent with the original answer, making it relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially covers the information presented in the original answer, focusing specifically on where to obtain a duplicate construction permit. The original answer mentions that the construction permit is not compulsorily examined, whereas the generated answer talks about applying for a new permit. This difference in scope and focus reduces the overall relevance of the generated answer, making it PARTLY_RELEVANT instead of RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is somewhat relevant as it provides the same conditions for a person temporarily being held in a prison sentence to be considered for early release. However, it is not entirely relevant as the original statement is a complete answer that explains the conditions, while the generated answer is focused on a specific portion of those conditions."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially overlaps with the original answer, as it correctly mentions the role of the Ủy ban nhân dân cấp xã in confirming the execution of regulations and issuing permits. However, it omits the detail about the Ủy ban nhân dân cấp xã being involved in the evaluation process and does not explicitly mention the requirement of confirmation from other entities (such as the unit where the person resides, military unit, or medical treatment facility). The generated answer focuses mainly on the role of the Ủy ban nhân dân cấp xã, while the original answer provides a broader context and more details about the conditions and entities involved in the process."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by providing additional information on the organizations that can confirm compliance with the law. However, it does not directly relate to the original answer's statement about the conditions for considering early release from prison. The generated answer also provides more specific and detailed information than the original answer, which is not a direct match."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely matches the context and content of the original answer. Both answers discuss the conditions under which a person on temporary detention can be considered for early parole. The generated answer specifically mentions the requirements for parole, which are also mentioned in the original answer. The only minor difference is the rephrasing of the conditions, but the overall meaning and content of the answers remain the same."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it provides the same structure and content. The generated answer is a direct paraphrase of the original answer, and the information presented is identical. The only difference is the slight rephrasing of the sentence structure, but the meaning and content remain the same. The generated answer correctly identifies the differences in organizational models between public and non-public libraries and provides the same details as the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses the responsibility and evaluation process for the manager of a state-owned enterprise, which is partly related to the original answer's discussion of the investment and operation of public libraries. However, the generated answer seems to be diverted from the original question's focus on the role of the state in investing and ensuring the operation of public libraries."
