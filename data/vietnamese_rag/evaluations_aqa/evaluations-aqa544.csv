PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original question by providing a specific fine range for using a phone while driving. However, it does not directly match the specified range provided in the original answer (100,000 - 300,000 dong).

Nevertheless, the generated answer conveys a similar idea of a specific fine range, making it partially relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is equivalent to the original answer, with a high degree of similarity in terms of content and context. The numbers '100.000 đồng đến 300.000 đồng' are identical in both answers, and the context of 'phạt' (fine) is also consistent between the two."
