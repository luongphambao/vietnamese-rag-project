PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original question about measures for managing a forest fire prevention and control project. However, it lacks specific information about the measures mentioned in the original answer, such as 'quản lý, duy tu bảo dưỡng, sửa chữa theo đúng quy định' and focuses more on the general guidelines for building a forest fire prevention and control project. The answer also introduces additional information about reducing flammable materials and having a plan to prevent forest fires, which is not present in the original answer. This partial relevance evaluation is due to the generated answer only partially addressing the original question and providing some related but not entirely accurate information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by mentioning the purpose of building the firebreak routes, but misses the broader context and scope of fire prevention and control infrastructure described in the original answer."
