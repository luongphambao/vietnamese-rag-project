However, the exact ranges are not identical, and the generated answer also provides a specific decree as a reference, which was not present in the original answer. Overall, the generated answer captures the correct intention and theme of the original answer but is not a direct match."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides related information about the fine for individuals setting up illegal shelters in highway tunnels, but it lacks the specific fine range mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer focuses on the average fine (500,000-1,000,000 VND) and the minimum fine (500,000 VND), but does not cover the entire range of 6,000,000 to 8,000,000 VND for individuals mentioned in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by providing the difference in fines between individuals and organizations, but the fine ranges provided are incorrect, which leads to a lower relevance score compared to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it mentions the registration of business, which is mentioned in the original answer. However, the main point of the original answer is discussing the reduction of working capital and its impact on the registration of a private enterprise. The generated answer diverts attention away from this and talks about the regulation of having less than 50 shareholders to establish a private enterprise. It is a related topic but not directly addressing the question of reducing working capital's influence on business registration."
