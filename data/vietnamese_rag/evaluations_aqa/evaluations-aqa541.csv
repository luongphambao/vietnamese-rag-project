Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer tries to build upon the original answer by providing additional context about the penalty for not turning on headlights at night. However, it veers off topic by discussing the necessity of turning on headlights at night, which is not the main point of the original answer. It does acknowledge the range of the penalty (800,000 - 1,000,000 VND), which shows some relevance to the original answer. Overall, the generated answer is partly relevant, but not as comprehensive and focused as the original answer."

The context and content of the generated answer match precisely with the original answer, indicating high relevance."

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not directly answer the generated question, but it contains some relevant information. The answer mentions a possible understanding of what constitutes a violation related to traffic safety, which is relevant to the original answer about a fine range.

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question 'Theo luật, họ thân nhân nào được hỗ trợ khi thăm viếng mộ liệt sĩ?' by mentioning the concept of supporting relatives when visiting the martyr's grave. However, the generated answer diverges from the original answer by providing incorrect information about the regulation of supporting relatives. Instead, it discusses the procedure for visiting a person in a detention center, which is unrelated to the original answer's topic. The generated answer also does not directly answer the question about who is eligible for support when visiting a martyr's grave."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer touches on the topic of support for traveling to visit the graves of war heroes, which is relevant to the original answer.

The generated answer also tries to draw an analogy with a different context, but it does not provide relevant information or answer the original question. The relevance is low as the generated answer does not address the original question accurately."

However, the generated answer does not directly address the original question about the support provided by LĐTBXH, instead focusing on the military's support for war invalids."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is longer and provides more specific information than the original answer, it is still relevant as it discusses the potential punishment for a driver who transports waste, including the possibility of having their license revoked.

RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'Thời gian tước bằng lái đối với tài xế xe ô tô vi phạm quy định chở phế thải là từ 01 tháng đến 03 tháng' is relevant to the original answer 'Có, tài xế sẽ bị tước bằng lái từ 01 tháng đến 03 tháng' as it provides the same duration range (from 01 month to 03 months) for the license revocation time, but uses a different context (car type and substance) to support the same outcome. The answer is accurate and provides the similar information as the original answer while not being a direct copy."
