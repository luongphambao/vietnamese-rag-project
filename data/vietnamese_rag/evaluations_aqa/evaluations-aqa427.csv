Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is related to the original answer, as it addresses the same topic of a buyer's rights and responsibilities when a seller fails to provide necessary information and guidelines for using the property. The generated answer provides additional information and elaborates on the consequences of not meeting these responsibilities. Although it does not exactly mirror the original answer, it stays true to the core idea and provides relevant supporting details."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses the conditions for compensation (bồi thường) for damages, which is related to the original answer. However, the original answer primarily focuses on the condition for cancelling the contract and requesting compensation (hủy bỏ hợp đồng và yêu cầu bồi thường thiệt hại) due to the seller's failure to provide necessary information, whereas the generated answer is more focused on the responsibility of those causing the damage and the process of compensation. Although both answers touch on the theme of compensation, they are dealing with different aspects, making the relevance only partly relevant."

The original answer also includes the responsibility of the person receiving the document, which is not mentioned in the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question about the consequences of violating regulations on retrieving confidential documents, but it does so in a very general and vague manner. The original answer provides specific guidelines and consequences for non-compliance, whereas the generated answer focuses on a more general scenario involving a lack of accountability and reporting on anti-corruption activities. While the generated answer mentions a punishment of a warning, it lacks the specificity and context provided in the original answer."
