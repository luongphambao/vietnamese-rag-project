Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, covering the same points and using the same language. It correctly mentions the requirements for exporting radioactive materials in Group 1 and Group 2, specifically mentioning the need for proof of origin, proper packaging and labeling, and import permit from the relevant authorities of the importing country. The only minor difference is the slight rephrasing of the content, but overall, the generated answer is accurate and relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a paraphrased version of the original answer, focusing on the requirement of having documentation that proves the origin of the material. Although it does not provide the additional requirements mentioned in the original answer, it captures the essential point about the necessity of proof of origin."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the query by mentioning the country of origin (nước nhập khẩu) as being the competent authority. However, it lacks the specifics noted in the original answer, such as the requirement for a permit in cases where the exported radioactive material falls under Groups 1 and 2 according to QCVN 06:2010/BKHCN. The generated answer is relevant but incomplete compared to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially covers the same topics as the original answer, including the importance of checking, reviewing, and correcting the prices of materials, labor, and equipment during the calculation of the construction cost index. However, the generated answer provides more detailed information on the specific guidance and regulations to follow, such as the Ministry of Construction's circular on calculating and managing investment costs. The generated answer does not fully replicate the original answer's structure and content, but shares some similar information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relevant as it mentions the need to convert the data into a unit, which is a crucial step in processing and calculating indices. However, the specific unit (m2) and conversion rate provided are not accurate and do not match the original text, which mentions the need for conversion to the base period and recalculating the values of various inputs (materials, labor, etc.) to make them comparable."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the relevant information for the processing of construction cost indices. The answer mentions the need to check the market prices of input factors, which is a critical aspect of ensuring accurate calculations. Additionally, it provides specific details on how to determine prices for labor, materials, and equipment. However, the answer does not fully cover all the original answer's content, such as the requirement to review data structures and adjust calculations. Overall, the generated answer captures some key points, but lacks completeness and contextual understanding."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, with no modifications or changes. It accurately conveys the same information and context as the original answer, providing the same instructions and requirements for pharmaceutical facilities to re-export traditional medicine that has been recalled."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original question, but also veers off into unrelated topics. The answer mentions the time limit for the agency's review of export permit applications, which is vaguely related to the original question. However, the answer also goes off on a tangent to discuss the procedure for handling research papers, which is not relevant to the original question. The generated answer provides some correct information, but its relevance to the original question is undermined by the non-relevant details."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately paraphrases the original answer, maintaining the same context and structure. The only difference is the use of 'thuốc cổ traditional' instead of 'thuốc cổ truyền', which is a minor variation. The generated answer answers the generated question adequately, providing the same information as the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly paraphrases the key point from the original answer, which is the requirement of explaining the reason for disapproval in a document if the Ministry of Health disapproves the re-exportation of traditional medicine. The generated answer is very similar to the original answer in terms of content, showing a high level of relevance and accuracy."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by providing information on how the fund management company uses the fund's assets. However, it only gives a general overview of the rules and regulations governing the use of fund assets, and does not directly answer the question about how the company uses the fund's assets. The original answer provides more specific information on the company's activities, whereas the generated answer is more general and does not match the tone and level of detail of the original answer."
