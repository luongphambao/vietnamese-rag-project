Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, with the same structure, wording, and format. The only difference is that it's a response to a specific question. The answer covers the same requirements for a pharmacy business to obtain a license, including the conditions for a manager to be certified. The relevance is high because the generated answer directly answers the question and provides the same information as the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, both in terms of content and context. The generated answer explicitly quotes the regulations in the Law on Pharmaceutical Administration 2005, which is the main topic of the original answer. The generated answer also includes all the necessary conditions for a pharmacy to operate legally, which is the key information presented in the original answer. The only difference is that the generated answer rephrases the original answer in a slightly different way, but the core information remains the same."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially refers to the original answer by mentioning the importance of technique in the process of producing, storing, distributing, and using drugs, which is indeed a requirement for a business to operate legally. However, it does not mention the additional requirement of professional staff with the necessary expertise, which is a crucial condition for a business to operate according to the original answer. The generated answer also asks a similar question as the original text, which is not directly answering the question of what is needed in addition to infrastructure and technology, making it somewhat relevant but not fully."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains some relevant information about the certificate being issued to organizations or individuals who meet certain conditions, but it is not a direct answer to the original question. The original question asks who receives the certificate, while the generated answer describes the criteria for receiving it."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, both in terms of the language used and the specific values mentioned. The only difference is that the generated answer is in response to a specific question about the fine for illegally dismantling a divider, whereas the original answer is a general statement about fines for individuals and organizations. However, the range of fine values provided in the generated answer is identical to that in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it matches the fine range for individuals in the original answer (from 5.000.000 to 7.000.000 đồng). However, the specific context of the question is different (phá dỡ thiết bị an toàn giao thông) from the original context (not specified), which reduces the relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the organization's penalty for violating safety regulations on road infrastructure, which is a specific scenario mentioned in the original answer (penalty for organization). The answer's range ($10,000,000 - $14,000,000) matches the corresponding range in the original answer, demonstrating a high similarity in content and context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of the fine amounts. The generated answer correctly mentions the maximum fine for individuals and organizations, but the question asked specifically about the removal of a mirror ball on the road, whereas the original answer is a general statement about the fines for individuals and organizations. The generated answer is related but is not a direct answer to the original question, hence PARTLY_RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of the question being asked. The generated answer addresses the difference in fine levels between individual and organization when demolishing safety equipment. However, the fine ranges provided in the generated answer are quite different from the original answer, which makes it partially relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially responds to the generated question, providing information about the timing of creating the report outline for ĐMC. However, it does not provide direct information about the timing of creating the report outline as mentioned in the original answer, which states that it is done simultaneously with the strategy outline, master planning, and investment project report. The generated answer deviates from the original answer by introducing unrelated information about the context and asserting that there is no information about ĐMC in the context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer. While it does mention the timing of reporting, it is not a direct answer to the question 'Báo cáo ĐMC được lập vào lúc nào?' (When is the ĐMC report prepared?). The answer instead provides a vague statement about the duration of approving a proposal. The original answer and question were about synchronizing the document, whereas the generated answer seems to be unrelated."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the relationship between the research report and the timeline of the project, but it provides additional information about the specific steps involved in submitting the project proposal. This information is not explicitly mentioned in the original answer, which only mentions the simultaneity of the research report and project proposal. The generated answer slightly diverts from the original answer's context, but still shows some connection to the topic."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the process of determining the fluctuation range of listed stocks, highlighting the role of the Stock Exchange of Vietnam and the State Securities Commission of Vietnam in the decision-making process. The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it maintains the same level of detail and provides additional context to clarify the relationships between the two entities."
