Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer. It accurately states that AS Monaco did not sell Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid, despite Real Madrid's offer of 103 million pounds (120 million euros). The generated answer also provides the same contextual information about the rejected offer and AS Monaco's desire to keep Mbappe for at least one more season. The content and context of the generated answer are identical to the original answer, making it highly relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the correct economic value in euro, which is mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer focuses solely on the euro value, whereas the original answer provides more context about the negotiation process and AS Monaco's intention to hold onto Kylian Mbappe for at least one more season. The generated answer lacks this contextual information, making it partially relevant but not entirely accurate."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relevant because it mentions the 103 million pounds offer from Real Madrid, which is mentioned in the original answer. However, it is not directly relevant as it does not confirm or deny whether the transfer fee is included in the 103 million pounds. Instead, it provides additional information about the offer, which does not address the specific question being asked."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the relevant information from the original answer, including the fact that AS Monaco wants to keep Mbappé for at least one more season and the reason for it (hence rejecting Real Madrid's 103 million pound bid). While the generated answer also provides additional information about the World Cup 2018, it does not distract from the main point and is still relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant to the original answer because it shares the same topic of Cao Ngân's hobby, which is singing. The majority of the content and context is identical to the original answer. However, the generated answer still addresses a different question ('Ngoài nghề người mẫu, Cao Ngân còn đam mê việc gì?') which deviates from the context of the original answer. It also lacks the original question's focus on Cao Ngân's motivation and emotional benefit from singing."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer, as it accurately summarizes Cao Ngân's sentiment towards singing and its effects on her feelings. The generated answer also mirrors the same phrasing and structure as the original answer, making it easy to recognize the relevance and similarity between both."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, as it conveys Cao Ngân's emotions and feelings when she sings. The words used, such as 'thư thái', 'giải tỏa', and 'thoải mái hơn nhiều', are identical to those used in the original answer, and the sentences are structured similarly. The main idea and meaning of the generated answer are consistent with the original answer. However, some minor changes, such as the use of 'cô' instead of 'Tôi' and rephrasing of some sentences, do not affect the overall relevance and similarity of the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant to the original answer as it still addresses the idea that Cao Ngân sings for stress relief, but it lacks the nuance and emotional expression found in the original answer. The phrase 'Theo Cao Ngân' repeats the original question, which is not relevant to the original content. The generated answer also omits the original's tone and personal touch, making it less engaging and authentic."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partly responds to the question, but it does not address the specific information about the missile that Nga just tested successfully, which is mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer talks about a different type of missile (ICBM Topol RS-12M) and does not provide the details about the missile Zircon mentioned in the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer, which mentions Nga testing a Zircon missile successfully, and the topic of Russia being a country. The generated answer is about the United States, which is an entirely different country."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the same information as the original answer, stating that the successful supersonic missile tested by Russia is indeed the Zircon. The answer is not only relevant but also a direct repetition of the original answer, indicating a high level of similarity and accuracy."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides additional information about the speed of Zircon missile, which is related to the original answer. The original answer mentions that Zircon has a supersonic speed, and the generated answer provides a specific example of how it is 8 times faster than the speed of sound. The context remains the same, and the generated answer provides useful and relevant information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly provides information about the length of the coastline suffering from erosion in Cà Mau, which is a key piece of information mentioned in the original answer. Although the generated question is a query, the answer still conveys relevant information to the original text."
