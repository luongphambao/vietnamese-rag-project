Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer mentions the ministry of education (Bộ Giáo dục và Đào tạo), it does not directly answer the question about what they are responsible for (sách giáo khoa giáo dục phổ thông). Instead, it provides information about the ministry's role in managing the content of a teacher training program. While the ministry is mentioned, the context and content of the answer are not directly related to the original answer, hence it's considered PARTLY_RELEVANT."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially answers the question by providing the responsibilities of the Minister of Education and Training. However, it does not directly answer the question about the rights and responsibilities of the Minister, but instead provides more specific tasks related to textbook development. The answer is relevant in the sense that it offers some related but not identical information, but it does not fully answer the original question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it refers to the Education sector, which is the main topic in the original answer. However, the generated answer does not provide the same level of specificity, failing to mention the responsibility of the Minister of Education and Training, which is a key point in the original answer."

While it mentions the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Training in selecting textbooks for educational institutions, it does not explicitly state that the Minister is responsible for textbooks, as is the case in the original answer. Therefore, the answer is not entirely accurate, but it does contain some relevant information."

The original answer also mentions a 24-month limit for bến khách ngang sông, which is not addressed in the generated answer. The generated answer is not entirely relevant due to the scope limitation."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer by providing a time limit for preparing the files. However, it does not provide the exact time limit (not exceeding 24 months) mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer also fails to address the exception for the construction project."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it addresses the same topic (time constraints for building wharfs/piers) and provides a logical comparison between time limits for different types of wharfs (bến khách ngang sông and bến thủy nội địa).

The generated answer is a direct quote from the original text and provides the same information in a concise manner."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately mentions the type of company (chứng khoán riêng lẻ) and the maximum number of shareholders (99) which are present in the original answer.

However, the original answer provides more context and information about the conditions for shareholders, including the maximum number of shareholders, the minimum contribution requirements for both institutional and individual shareholders, and the requirements for self-management companies. The generated answer is only partially relevant as it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question, missing the other important details from the original answer."

While the answer is somewhat relevant, it does not directly answer the original question about the number of delegates in a 5000-person commune. Instead, it provides a related piece of information, making it partly relevant."
