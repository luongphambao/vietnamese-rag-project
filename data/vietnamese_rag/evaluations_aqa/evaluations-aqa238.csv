Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly mentions Nacho, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Kroos as the goalscorers for Real Madrid, which matches the original answer. Although it mentions 5 goals which is incorrect (the original answer states 4 goals), the core information about the scorers is accurate, making it relevant."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer only provides information about which round of Liga (37) the match between Real Madrid and Sevilla belongs to, whereas the original answer provides detailed information about the match scores and goalscorers. The generated answer lacks context and relevance to the original answer, and does not provide any information about the match result or goalscorers, making it non-relevant."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer in terms of content and context. Both answer mention the specific topic and context, namely the draft education program, and both mention the proposal to treat creative experience as a separate subject. The generated answer also touches on some of the same issues and challenges mentioned in the original answer, such as the need for teachers to be trained and the potential role of schools in providing such training. The main difference is that the generated answer is more concise and focused, but this does not affect its overall relevance to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the main topic of the original answer, i.e., the role of experience-based learning in the draft education program. However, it lacks specific details and context provided in the original answer. The generated answer focuses more on the general benefits of experience-based learning, whereas the original answer raises concerns about the implementation and responsibility of teachers in carrying out these activities."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer because it mentions the challenge of implementing innovative activities and the related issues, similar to the original answer. However, the generated answer lacks the specific details and points mentioned in the original answer, such as the role of teachers and the need for training programs for educators."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a near-direct copy of the original answer, with the same structure, wording, and content. The only minor difference is the rephrased sentence at the beginning, which does not affect the overall coherence and relevance of the answer. The generated answer largely duplicates the original answer, covering the same questions and concerns raised in the original text, making it highly relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it provides the correct score (6-0) for a Champions League match. However, the match mentioned in the generated answer is between Real Madrid and APOEL Nicosia, whereas the original answer mentions Real Madrid's match against an opponent whose name is not specified. Although the score is correct, the context is different, making the relevance partial."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially corresponds to the original answer in terms of providing information about Real Madrid's achievement after a win. However, it does not include the additional details mentioned in the original answer, such as Ronaldo's goals and the impact on his Champions League goal-scoring record."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it provides information about Cristiano Ronaldo's goal scoring in a specific match, which is related to the original answer's mention of Ronaldo's goal scoring in the Champions League. However, the generated answer is not entirely relevant because it provides information about a different match (Real Madrid vs Celta Vigo) compared to the original answer's mention of a different match (Champions League 2017), and the score mentioned in the generated answer is also different from the original answer's 6-0 score."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer states that Ronaldo scored 5 goals at the Champions League in 2017, which is not only incorrect but also out of context. The original answer mentions that Ronaldo scored 8 goals, and the generated question and answer seem to be unrelated to the context of the original text, which discusses Real Madrid's win and Ronaldo's performance in the Champions League in 2017."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer provides a numerical value related to Ronaldo's goal-scoring record at Champions League, it is not directly relevant to the original answer's mention of Ronaldo's goal-scoring record in a specific year (2017). The generated answer also exceeds the scope of the original answer's context by providing a cumulative value (368 goals) instead of a yearly record. While it's partially related, it's not a direct response to the original question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is essentially a copy of the original answer, providing the same information and context. It accurately answers the generated question and matches the original answer in terms of content and detail."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is mostly relevant as it accurately reports the result of the match between Real Madrid and Al Jazira in the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup. The answer also mentions Real Madrid advancing to the final, which is consistent with the original answer. Although the tone and sentence structure differ slightly, the key information is preserved, making the generated answer relevant to the original answer."
