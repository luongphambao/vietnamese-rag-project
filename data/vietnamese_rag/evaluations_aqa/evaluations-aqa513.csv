Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the original answer, capturing the main points about the payment arrangement for investors in a BT contract signed before 2018. The generated answer has identical wording and structure to the original answer, covering the key aspects of continuation of payment according to the contract and applicability of relevant laws. The only minor difference is the rephrasing of the question in the generated answer, but this does not affect the overall relevance and accuracy of the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately responds to the question and provides the same list of laws and regulations mentioned in the original text, albeit in a slightly condensed form. Although it does not fully capture the nuances of the original text, it maintains the same core information and legal references, making it overall relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partly covers the condition of using land and office premises for payment to the BT investor, specifically the condition of determining the value of the BT project. However, it omits other necessary conditions mentioned in the original answer, such as ensuring compatibility with approved land use plans, reporting to the Prime Minister, and ensuring equivalent value of the land and office premises. The answer also mixes information about land and office premises, and expands on it with additional details not present in the original answer, making it less relevant overall."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer touches on a related topic, namely BHXH, but the context and focus are slightly off. While it mentions the time frame for contribution to BHXH, it does not address the original question's concern about the procedure for closing or terminating BHXH, nor does it provide the requested clarification on the specific scenario of a business owner absconding. The answer provides some relevant information, but it is not directly relevant to the original question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the question by providing some potential locations for consultation, including các cơ quan bảo hiểm xã hội, các cơ quan y tế, và các văn phòng thừa phát lại. However, it does not directly answer the question and provides a more general answer that is related to the topic but not a direct answer to the original question. The original answer provides a direct statement that there is no clear procedure for closing a social insurance book for a case of a business owner absconding based on the provided information, while the generated answer takes a more general approach by providing potential consultation locations. The latter's relevance to the original answer is limited, but it does still provide related information that could be useful for someone seeking to find answers."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, with the only difference being the spelling mistake 'Luato' instead of 'Phạt'. The content and context of the generated answer match the original answer perfectly, which suggests high relevance and similarity."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is related to the generation question, but the answer category-shifted from a specific fine range to a broader fine range. The original answer mentions a specific fine range of 30.000.000 - 40.000.000 đồng, while the generated answer provides a different range 40.000.000 - 70.000.000 đồng. The relevance is partly because the generated answer still discusses fine limits, but the similarity is partially lost due to the different range."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the original answer verbatim, indicating high relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is similar to the original answer, both providing the same fine range (30,000,000 - 40,000,000 VND) for a specific scenario (lawyer's penalty for providing fake evidence). The only difference is in the question wording, but the answer remains identical, implying a high degree of relevance and accuracy."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer, as it provides a specific range of fines for a specific scenario, whereas the original answer provides a different range of fines for an unspecified scenario. The context and content of the generated answer are unrelated to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some related information, as it mentions a specific case where the rapid test is used (HIV testing). However, it does not accurately answer the question about when the rapid test is typically used. The original answer mentions that it is used for 'xét nghiệm tại chỗ' (on-site testing), but the generated answer does not mention that. The connection between the rapid test and HIV testing is not explicitly discussed in the original answer, making it partly relevant but not entirely accurate."
