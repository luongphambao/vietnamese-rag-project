Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it directly answers the question about the entity that converts the world gold price to Vietnamese dong for comparison with SJC gold price, which is a key piece of information in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer matches the content of the original answer, providing the correct price of SJC gold at the final trading session on December 7th, which is 36,45 million dong/liter, with a decrease of 150,000 dong/liter compared to the opening price of the morning session. The generated answer is also a direct response to the generated question, indicating a high level of similarity and relevance to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information, as it mentions the price of SJC gold and the amount of decrease compared to the morning opening price. However, it lacks important context, such as the actual price of SJC gold at the time of evaluation (36,45 million VND/lb), and provides incorrect numbers for the decrease in price (it's 150,000 VND/lb, not 60,000/40,000 VND/lb as mentioned in the generated answer)."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer as it mentions 'giá bán còn giữ nguyên từ năm 2018' (price remaining the same since 2018), which is a similar concept to the original answer. However, the generated answer does not provide specific information about other Toyota models, unlike the original answer which mentions specific price ranges for the Toyota Camry."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately reproduces the same ranges of price (997 triệu đồng to 1,302 tỷ đồng) as the original answer, and is a direct response to the question. It demonstrates a high degree of similarity and relevance to the original answer, indicating that it is a relevant answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains the same information as the original answer, specifically the price range of the Toyota Camry model in 2018. However, it lacks the additional context that the original answer provided, which is that the price was kept unchanged from 2018. The generated answer does not provide this additional context, making it PARTLY_RELEVANT."
