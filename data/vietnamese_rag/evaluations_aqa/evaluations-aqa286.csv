Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing a direct quote. This level of similarity and relevance is crucial for a retrieval-augmented generation system, as it suggests the system's ability to retrieve and reproduce accurate information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant to the original answer as it attempts to provide details about the project's goal, but deviates from the core information provided in the original answer. While the original answer mentions reducing accidents at sea, the generated answer focuses on a specific scenario (a storm) and presents it as an example of the project's effectiveness. The connection between the project's goal and the specific scenario is not explicitly made, making the generated answer only partially relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, and both state the same purpose of the project, which is to reduce marine accidents. The only minor difference is the wording and sentence structure, but the overall message is consistent."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is a replay of the original answer, it still conveys the same information and idea as the original answer. The generated answer provides additional details about the project's cost and interest from shipping companies, which is relevant to the original answer's topic. The relevance of the generated answer lies in its ability to provide more context and supporting evidence for the original answer's claim about the project's purpose."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the essence of the original answer, mentioning some common marine accidents, but it fails to directly address the goal of reducing accidents mentioned in the original answer. The generated answer focuses on specific types of accidents, whereas the original answer highlights the goal of reducing accidents in general."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is semantically equivalent to the original answer. It accurately conveys the same information, including the method used by Nguyễn Thiện Như to support foreigners in learning Vietnamese, which is selecting English words that are phonetically similar to the names of animals in Vietnamese."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, as it starts with the same sentence structure and provides the same information about Nguyễn Thiện Như's method of using English words with Vietnamese animal names to help international students learn Vietnamese. The only difference is that the generated question is not the same as the original answer. The generated answer accurately answers the generated question while providing a slightly different context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer in the sense that it does mention the concept of using English words with similar sounds to Vietnamese animal names. However, the context and purpose mentioned in the generated answer (explaining and describing symptoms of a disease) are significantly different from the original answer (helping foreigners learn Vietnamese). The generated answer lacks the connection to language learning and instead focuses on a different domain, making it only partly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer because it mentions Nguyễn Thiện Như's approach of using English words with similar sounds to Vietnamese animal names to help foreigners learn Vietnamese. The generated answer also mentions a specific resource (YouTube clip) where this approach is applied, which is consistent with the original answer. Although the details are not identical, the core idea and context are preserved."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the original answer, providing the specific laws violated by Ông Lê Quang Tuyến including the use of unauthorized chemicals and lack of registration for business activities. The generated answer also includes additional details present in the original answer, but this does not detract from its overall relevance. The key points and structure of the original answer are well-represented in the generated answer, making it a relevant and accurate response."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it provides the same information about the violations of the law, including the lack of business registration and the use of unpermitted and untraceable chemicals. The answer is almost identical to the original answer, only rephrasing the sentences slightly. This suggests a strong correlation between the generated answer and the original answer, indicating a high level of relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly relevant to the original answer as it accurately reproduces the main points of the original answer. It also maintains the same sentence structure and wording, suggesting that the generated answer is reproducing the original answer rather than generating a new one. The minor difference lies in the wording of the question, which is included in the generated answer, whereas in the original answer, it is presented as a separate setup. Nevertheless, the answer itself is highly relevant and similar to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially overlapping with the original answer, as it mentions the same specific details about the unauthorized use of chemicals in food production. While the phraseology is not identical, the information conveyed is similar, making it relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it provides a specific example from the original answer, which is the lack of clear origin of chemical substances used in production and their unlisted or unauthorised use. The generated answer is a more detailed and specific interpretation of the original answer's information."
