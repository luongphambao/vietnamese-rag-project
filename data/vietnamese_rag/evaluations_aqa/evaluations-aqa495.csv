The original answer clearly states that the funding should be done in accordance with the official program and plan, as well as the budget allocation. The generated answer, on the other hand, provides unclear information about the methods used to determine costs. This makes the generated answer only partly relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer lists several conditions that must be met when using funds to build legal documents, which aligns with the original answer's requirement that 'kem phí phải đúng mục đích, theo quy định của pháp luật' (budgeted funds must be used for their intended purpose, according to the law). Although the generated answer enumerates more specific requirements than the original answer, it is still relevant to the context of financial management and the use of funds for legal document construction."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions a specific regulation (Thông tư 63/2019/NĐ-CP) related to the usage of budget for building law texts, which is partially relevant to the original answer. However, the scope of the generated answer is narrower and more specific than the original answer, which discusses the overall budget allocation for law texts and the necessity to follow official programs and plans, as well as regulations. The generated answer only focuses on a particular regulation, whereas the original answer provides a broader context."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it discusses the topic of punishing behavior that converts forest land for use, which is similar to the original answer. However, the specific penalty range is not completely matched, with the original answer mentioning 80-100 million while the generated answer mentions 40-60 million. The context of the forest land area (2,500-3,500 m2) also does not match the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer, as both discuss fines for incorrect land use. However, the specific charges (amounts) mentioned in the generated answer differ from those in the original answer. The generated answer provides a more detailed breakdown by area size, whereas the original answer provides a range of 80,000,000 đ - 100,000,000 đ. While the answers overlap in their discussion of fines, they do not exactly match, making the relevance partial rather than full."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the context of the original answer in terms of the topic (penalties for utilizing forest for non-forest purposes).

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant to the original answer because it mentions the responsibility of the State Bank to update the information related to the loan status of the beneficiary. However, the generated answer does not provide specific information about the processes of updating the information in the national credit information database, which is mentioned in the original answer. Additionally, the generated answer provides some irrelevant information about not being able to provide an answer due to the scope of the area. The answer is not entirely irrelevant, but it does not fully capture the relevant information from the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant as it mentions the role of Bộ Tài chính in the process of guaranteeing foreign loans. However, the specific point mentioned about Thủ tướng Chính phủ canceling debt is not mentioned in the original answer, which focuses on the responsibility of Ngân hàng Nhà nước and the interaction between Bộ Tài chính and Ngân hàng Nhà nước.

Despite the partial relevance, the generated answer does not provide a complete or accurate representation of the original answer's content."
