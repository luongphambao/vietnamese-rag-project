PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially answers the question by providing the condition for the US to lift the ban on visa issuance. However, it does not provide the same level of detail as the original answer, which explains the specific circumstances and consequences of the ban for each country. The generated answer is concise and accurate, but it lacks the context and specificity of the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially conveys the main reason why President Trump may be 'very tough' with NATO regarding the 2% GDP contribution goal. It mentions that many NATO member countries have not achieved the unified target of 2% GDP for military spending, which is a key point from the original answer. However, the generated answer lacks the additional context about the current achievements of some NATO member countries and the US being the largest financial contributor, which is an important detail that provides nuance to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct quote from the original answer, focusing on the same topic of the US President's requirements for NATO members to meet the 2% GDP defense spending target. The generated answer partially reuses the same sentence structure and phrases as the original answer, indicating a high level of similarity and relevance."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is unrelated to the original answer, which discusses the US President's potential stance on NATO due to member countries not meeting the 2% GDP defense spending target.

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially addresses the original answer's content, but with a different focus. While the generated answer provides information on which NATO countries will meet the 2% GDP target within a specific timeframe, the original answer discusses the President's demands for NATO members to achieve this target and the current state of compliance. The generated answer does not address the President's stance or the global picture, making it only partially relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer mentions the same timeframe (từ tháng 3 đến cuối tháng 9) and similar content about violating organizations, it is not a direct replication of the original answer. The original answer provides more detailed information about the nature of the violations, whereas the generated answer only mentions the number of cases and organizations. The fact that the generated answer does not include all the specific details mentioned in the original answer, such as the reasons for the violations, reduces its relevance."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately extracts the specific information mentioned in the original text, which is the number of cases of violation (15) that were punished.

The original answer mentions that after inspecting 79 businesses, 15 cases of violations were found, including issues with quality, labeling, and registration. The generated question asks about the main violations of producers of inorganic fertilizers in Long An, and the answer provided repeats the same violations mentioned in the original answer. The only difference is the spatial specificity of the location 'Long An', which is minor and does not affect the relevance of the generated answer to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is largely similar to the original answer, as it also highlights the same main violations found in the audit, including quality issues, labeling violations, and lack of registration and documentation. However, the generated answer does not provide additional information and is not an exact duplication of the original answer."

The main points, such as cooking with heart and love, using flexible ingredients, and aiming for nutritious and delicious food, are all present in both answers.

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer captures some of the key points mentioned in the original answer, such as the importance of ingredients and spices in creating a nutritious and delicious dish.
