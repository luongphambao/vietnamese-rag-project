Relevance,Explanation
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses Article 95 of a law, which is about exempting pregnant women from training, whereas the original answer requires a written document with a notarized certificate. The two answers are about different topics and have no clear connection, indicating a lack of relevance."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions some exceptions where permission letters are not required, which is a part of the context of the original answer. However, it does not directly address the requirement of writing a formal document with certification, which is the main focus of the original answer. The generated answer is related but not directly relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the range of fines for lấn chiếm (encroachment) in a forest, which is relevant to the original answer's topic of fines for environmental offenses. However, the specific range of fines mentioned in the generated answer (25.000.000 đồng to 32.000.000 đồng) is partially accurate, as the original answer mentions a range of 32.000.000 đồng to 40.000.000 đồng, but not the exact range. The generated answer does not exactly match the original, but shares the same general topic and format, making it PARTLY_RELEVANT."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a different range of fine values (1.000.000 - 3.000.000 VND) for a specific scenario (under 2.000 m2) whereas the original answer mentions a completely different range (32.000.000 - 40.000.000 VND). The context, fine amount, and conditions are not matching, making the generated answer non-relevant."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it provides a range of fine, which is similar to the original answer. However, the original answer specifies a specific range of 32.000.000 đồng to 40.000.000 đồng, while the generated answer only specifies a part of the range (20.000.000 đồng to 40.000.000 đồng)."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is related to the original answer in that it discusses the fine for occupying forest protection area, but it uses a different range of sizes (12.000-15.000 m2) compared to the original answer (32.000.000-40.000.000 đồng). The generated answer also provides a more detailed calculation based on a specific context, whereas the original answer is a direct fine range. While the answers share a similar topic, the specific information and range of sizes differ, resulting in a PARTLY_RELEVANT evaluation."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct reformulation of the original answer, providing the same information and numerical values. It accurately recapitulates the original answer, showing a high degree of similarity and relevance."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not address the original question, which asks for the area of the Law Enforcement Badge. Instead, the generated answer provides a description of the badge's design, which is not relevant to the original question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is very similar to the original answer, covering almost the same information about the design of the Police badge. The only difference is that the generated answer does not provide additional information about the metal colors used (vàng, trắng bạc) unlike the original answer."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a question that is identical to the original question, rather than a generated answer relevant to the inquiry about the badge being attached to a hat. The relevant information from the original answer about the attachment of the badge to the hat is not present in the generated answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer 'Cành tùng trên mũ có màu vàng' is relevant because it is a direct extract from the original answer, which states that 'Cành tùng có màu vàng cho cấp tướng, cấp tá'. Although the generated question is different from the original text, the answer still corresponds to the information provided in the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer by mentioning that a contract can be represented by the party's name, which is in line with the original answer. However, the generated answer also introduces a new idea by mentioning the possibility of representation in different contexts, whereas the original answer specifically emphasizes the impossibility of self-representation and representation by the same person. The generated answer lacks the specificity and clarity of the original answer, making it less relevant overall."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it discusses the scope and limitations of a representative's authority in establishing and implementing civil transactions. While it touches on the idea that a representative cannot establish a transaction with the represented party, the generated answer goes beyond that to provide more detailed information on the various circumstances under which a representative can or cannot engage in transactions. The generated answer does not fully align with the original answer, which primarily deals with the concept of a representative not being able to establish a transaction with themselves or a third party that they also represent."
