RELEVANT,"The generated answer is highly similar to the original answer, with the same numerical value ('6') and identical context. The generated question and answer together form a complete answer to the user's original question. The only difference is the inclusion of the time frame 'gần đây' (recently) in the generated answer, which is a minor variation and does not affect the relevance of the answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer is partially correct, it does not fully cover the content and context of the original answer. The original answer mentions the involvement of both the police and the military, mentioning that the military is ready to intervene if needed, whereas the generated answer only focuses on the police. The answer could have further explored this complexity."

While the content is relevant, the lack of augmentation or modification to the original answer makes it less useful and less original. A relevant RAG system should aim to learn from the original answer and generate a new one that builds upon it, rather than simply copying it."

This dilutes the relevance of the generated answer, making it PARTLY_RELEVANT rather than RELEVANT."
