Relevance,Explanation
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original answer in terms of context, but it is not entirely relevant. The generated answer only mentions Ban quản lý dự án trực thuộc Tổng công ty Truyền tải điện Quốc Gia and its subsidiaries, whereas the original answer describes a broader range of units belonging to the electric power companies, including provincial and district-level companies, and other units. The generated answer also asks a question (which is not part of the original answer) and does not directly address the question 'Có những đơn vị nào trực thuộc Ban quản lý dự án các Tổng công ty điện lực?'"
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it is a partial reproduction of the original text, focusing on the specific question asked. While it doesn't cover all the information provided in the original answer, it does provide some important details, such as the names of the specific companies (Tổng công ty Điện lực thành phố Hồ Chí Minh and Tổng công ty Điện lực thành phố Hà Nội) and their relationship with the other companies."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is closely related to the original answer. It directly addresses the same scenario, mentioning the exception for female notary officers who are pregnant or have a child under 12 months old. The generated answer provides the same information as the original answer, stating that they are exempt from annual occupational training. The only difference is that the generated answer is in the form of a question, followed by a brief answer, whereas the original answer is a list of exceptions. Overall, the generated answer is relevant and accurate, with some minor differences in format."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partly relevant because it mentions two cases where a notary officer can be exempted from annual professional development, which are the same cases mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer does not explicitly mention that these are examples of circumstances where a notary officer is exempted, but rather presents them as general conditions for exemption."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer. The original answer mentions specific circumstances under which a notary public can be exempted from annual professional development (pregnant/notifying a child under 12 months, or treatment for a long-term illness). The generated answer, on the other hand, talks about a different scenario involving medical treatment and patient guidance, which is unrelated to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant because it directly references the same condition mentioned in the original answer (b) for why a notary public can be exempt from annual vocational training. The generated answer also provides the same duration (03 tháng trở lên) and documentation (giấy chứng nhận của cơ quan y tế cấp huyện hoặc tương đương trở lên) mentioned in the original answer, indicating that it is a accurate extraction and summarization of the relevant information."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer ‘Bộ Y tế cấp’ is partially relevant to the original answer. The original answer mentions the requirement of a ‘giấy chứng nhận’ (health certificate) from a hospital or equivalent, while the generated answer only mentions the requirement of a health certificate from the Ministry of Health (Bộ Y tế). Although the generated answer is not entirely accurate, it partially captures the concept of the original answer and is relevant in that sense."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions the fact that trợ cấp phục viên is a leave without pay, which is correct. However, it also incorrectly states that trợ cấp phục viên một lần is zero, which is not in line with the original answer. The original answer mentions that trợ cấp phục viên một lần is calculated as 01 tháng tiền lương of the preceding month, whereas the generated answer completely contradicts this information, making it non-relevant in terms of the original answer's content."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer. The generated answer is a repeat of the generated question, which is not a meaningful response to the question 'Cơ sở tính toán trợ cấp phục viên một lần là gì?' and does not provide any relevant information about the calculation basis for one-time vocational assistance."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a duplicate of the generated question, lacking any relevant information related to the original answer. The generated answer does not provide a tangible explanation or calculation method for the retirement allowance, only repeating the question."
RELEVANT,"Although the generated answer does not answer the question directly, it still provides a relevant and accurate supporting statement. The answer acknowledges that the time point for calculating the one-time allowance for reserves is not mentioned in the context, which is consistent with the original answer, which describes the calculation formula. The generated answer is relevant as it provides a nuanced understanding of the information, even if it does not directly answer the question."
_NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer seems to be unrelated to the original answer, which is a specific formula for calculating one-time support allowance. The generated answer appears to be a question, and its content is not relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some relevant information regarding the responsibility of providing information related to the content of a complaint. However, it does not directly answer the question about who is responsible for providing information, as specified in the original answer. The generated answer mentions 'người xử lý đơn báo cáo' (the person processing the complaint) as being responsible, which is not mentioned in the original answer. While the generated answer is related to the topic, it does not provide a direct and accurate answer to the original question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is about the purpose of requesting information from organizations, individuals, etc. for the execution of criminal proceedings against commercial entities, which is not related to the original text that discusses the procedure for providing information and evidence for investigation purposes."
