Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the exact date and time of the fire incident at LS Vina Cable Hải Phòng. The relevance is high, and the answer matches the original answer in terms of content and context, confirming the accuracy of the generated answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it correctly mentions the unaffected area (khu vực sản xuất) but does not provide additional information on the affected areas, whereas the original answer mentions that the fire caused damage to the entire office area and equipment. The generated answer simply rephrases the original answer instead of adding new information."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the investigation into the cause of the fire, which is directly related to the original answer. Although the specific question being answered is different, the topic and context are the same. The generated answer provides relevant information regarding the investigation being conducted by the authorities."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does not mention the original event or context. It instead refers to a different event mentioned in the generated question, which is unrelated to the original topic. The generated answer also states that there is no information about the weather on the day of the event, which is not relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially captures the information about the damage caused by the fire, mentioning 'nhiều tài sản bị thiệt hại và hàng trăm công nhân bị ảnh hưởng'. However, it omits the specific details about the damage to the machinery and equipment, which are mentioned in the original answer. Additionally, the generated answer does not provide a clear connection to the context of the fire occurring in the company's office area, making it only partially relevant."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer contains a different time (15h 30 phút) and date (chiều ngày 7 tháng 5) compared to the original answer (17h 40 ngày 7/5). The locations are the same, but this is not enough to consider the generated answer relevant."
NON_RELEVANT,The generated answer is about a different location (before house 77 on Y Moan street) while the original answer is about a different location (on Tây Tựu street in Hà Nội). There is no relevance or similarity between the two answers.
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions the correct city 'Hà Nội' and hints at the correct district ('quận') as per the original answer. However, it incorrectly specifies the district as 'Hoàng Mai' instead of 'Nam Từ Liêm' which contradicts the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer ('7/5') shares the same date and location as the original answer. Although the original answer provides more information (time and location details), the generated answer provides the correct date which is the key information requested in the question."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not relevant to the original answer. The original answer provides a specific detail about an event that occurred at a certain location, while the generated answer is a response to a hypothetical question (asking why the event occurred at that location) and provides a general statement about the impossibility of limiting information about the event. The topics and contexts are entirely different, making the generated answer non-relevant to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides similar information about the 3 types of bombers (B-52H, B-1B, B-2A) and mentions the context of the deployment, including the strategic deterrence and the transmission of a message. While some details are missing and the wording is not identical to the original answer, the core information and concepts are preserved, making the generated answer relevant to the original one."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer shares some similarities with the original answer, as both mention that the deterrent strategy does not involve direct combat. However, the generated answer focuses more on the specific technology (hệ thống phòng thủ tên lửa) and its capabilities, whereas the original answer discusses the effectiveness and relevance of the deterrent strategy in relation to actual combat. The generated answer also introduces new information (the context of the US's modernization plan) that is not present in the original answer, which makes it less relevant."
