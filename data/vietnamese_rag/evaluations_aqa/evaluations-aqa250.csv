The generated answer lacks this context and seems unrelated to the original context."

However, it does not fully capture the context and nuance of the original answer, which mentioned Trump's right to hire and fire, but also acknowledged that people may not agree with his decisions. The generated answer focuses solely on Haley's disagreement with Trump's decisions, omitting the additional context provided in the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is relevant to the original answer as it still conveys the same point and opinion about President Trump's authority to hire and fire. Although the generated answer includes some additional information not present in the original answer, such as Nikki Haley being the US Ambassador to the UN, the core idea and quote from Haley remains the same.

PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it mentions the 'vụ cướp thế kỷ' (century-old heist) at the Antwerp diamond center, which is a specific event mentioned in the original answer. However, the generated answer provides no additional information and does not provide a correct response to the question, just a repetition of the question itself.

Therefore, the generated answer is only partially relevant due to mentioning the correct event, but lacks further details or a correct response."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially relates to the original answer by mentioning Notarbartolo's skill in 'phá mã' (breaking the code) during the Antwerp heist.

Despite this, the generated answer still conveys the general idea of Abagnale Jr.'s fraudulent activities, making it partially relevant to the original answer."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer partially matches the original context, as it mentions Frank William Abagnale Jr. and his card forgery activities. However, the specificity and accuracy of the generated answer are incomplete, as it only provides three countries (Japan, West Germany, and the US) whereas the original text does not specify the exact countries where he performed this activity.

While the generated answer is related to the topic, it does not fully capture the breadth and nuance of the original answer, hence the PARTLY_RELEVANT evaluation."

Although the format and context are slightly different, the content is identical, making it relevant to the original answer."
