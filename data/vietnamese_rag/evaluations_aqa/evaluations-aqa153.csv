Relevance,Explanation
RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about the start date of the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, which is mentioned in the original answer as 2015. The generated answer also provides additional context about the reasons behind the intervention, which matches the original answer. The only difference is that the generated answer is a sentence-long summary rather than a longer passage, but this does not affect the relevance of the answer to the question."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately identifies the specific group of rebels that the Saudi-led military coalition is fighting against in Yemen, which is in line with the original answer. The generated answer is a direct answer to the generated question and shares the same topic and context as the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides the same information as the original answer, which is the location of the farm with a free hot spring pool. Although the words used are slightly different, the meaning and context are identical, making it a relevant answer to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the same information about the farm in Utah, USA having a natural hot blue swimming pool for free. Although the context of the question has changed to asking about farms in general, the answer is still accurate and relevant to the original statement."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is partially relevant because it provides some information about the original context, mentioning a farm in Utah, USA, which has a hot spring with green pool. However, it does not directly answer the question about whether there are any farms abroad with free hot springs. Instead, it provides a negative statement without providing an alternative solution or further information to support its claim. This makes the relevance somewhat partial, as it only acknowledges the original context but does not contribute meaningfully to answering the new question."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions natural hot springs, which is partially relevant to the original answer. However, the location mentioned (Brazil - Lençóis Maranhenses) is not the same as the original answer (Utah, USA) and the bể bơi (swimming pool) is replaced with hồ bơi (natural pool) and the context is changed from a free public natural hot spring to a specific attraction in Brazil. The relevance is PARTLY_RELEVANT as it shares some similar concepts, but the context and location are significantly different."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer, 'Vị trí của trang trại có bể bơi nước nóng xanh biếc là Utah, Mỹ', is partly relevant to the original answer, 'Trang trại ở Utah, Mỹ có bể bơi nước nóng xanh biếc tự nhiên miễn phí.' Although the generated answer mentions Utah and Mỹ, it only answers a part of the original answer's information, namely the location, but not the additional details about the hot pool being natural and free."
PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a minor modification of the original answer, adding the phrase ""vào lúc"" (at the time) to provide more context. While it includes the same events and figures as the original answer, it is not an exact duplicate. The additional information slightly increases the relevance of the generated answer, making it PARTLY_RELEVANT, but it still deviates from the original answer in a minor way."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer mentions a river (sông Thu Bồn) and a province (Quảng Nam), which is completely different from the context described in the original answer, which mentions a precious ring being broken and falling on a ceramic floor in a shop in Yunnan, China."
NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer is not related to the original answer. The original answer describes a accident in a store in Vietnam and a valuable jade ring being dropped, while the generated answer talks about a lawsuit and people's actions, with no connection to the original incident."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, covering the same topic and providing the same information. The answer directly addresses the question 'Tại sao chiếc vòng ngọc lại bị vỡ làm đôi?' (Why was the gem ring broken in half?) and provides a specific reason for the breakage, making its relevance to the question high."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is identical to the original answer, providing the same information and context. It answers the generated question accurately, indicating a high degree of relevance and similarity to the original answer."
RELEVANT,"The generated answer is a direct reproduction of a part of the original answer, specifically the date '21.5'. The content and context of the generated answer match the original answer, providing the same information."
