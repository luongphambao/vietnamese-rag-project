# Vietnamese RAG Project

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for generating Vietnamese text. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and comprehensive datasets, this project seeks to enhance the quality and relevance of generated text, assisting in various natural language processing tasks.

## Dataset
As a Vietnamese speaker, I thought of creating a simple Vietnamese RAG project for my final project. I found Vietnamese RAG datasets on Huggingface.

This is the link to my datasets: [My datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DuyTa/vi_RAG/viewer/LegalRAG)

This dataset has four subsets, but I only use three of them: General Text, Legal, and Expert.

- The General subset contains data scraped from various internet sources, like newspapers, and includes text related to news.

- The Legal subset is about Vietnamese law.

- The Expert subset covers various fields, such as law, political science, biology, and physics.
